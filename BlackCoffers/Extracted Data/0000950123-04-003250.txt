PART I
 



Item 1. Business

     
Amerada Hess Corporation (the
Registrant) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated
in 1920. The Registrant and its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the Corporation) explore for,
produce, purchase, transport and sell crude oil and natural gas.
These exploration and production activities take place in the
United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial
Guinea, Algeria, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan,
Malaysia and other countries. The Corporation also manufactures,
purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum and other energy
products. The Corporation owns 50% of a refinery joint venture
in the United States Virgin Islands, and another refining
facility, terminals and retail gasoline stations located on the
East Coast of the United States.


Exploration and Production
     
At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had
646 million barrels of proved crude oil and natural gas
liquids reserves compared with 782 million barrels at the
end of 2002. Proved natural gas reserves were 2,332 million
Mcf at December 31, 2003 compared with 2,477 million
Mcf at December 31, 2002. These crude oil and natural gas
reserves included the Corporations proportionate share of
the reserves of equity investees in prior years. The decrease in
proved reserves resulted from asset sales and production. Proved
reserves at December 31, 2003 include 32% and 43%,
respectively, of crude oil and natural gas held under production
sharing contracts. Of the total proved reserves (on a barrel of
oil equivalent basis), 18% are located in the United States, 42%
are located in the United Kingdom, Norwegian and Danish sectors
of the North Sea and the remainder are located in Algeria,
Azerbaijan, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand and
Malaysia. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, 32% of the
Corporations December 31, 2003 worldwide proved
reserves are undeveloped (33% in 2002).

     
Worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids
production amounted to 259,000 barrels per day in 2003
compared with 325,000 barrels per day in 2002. Worldwide
natural gas production was 683,000 Mcf per day in 2003
compared with 754,000 Mcf per day in 2002. The Corporation
presently estimates that its 2004 barrel of oil equivalent
production will be approximately 13% less than 2003. The
Corporation is developing a number of oil and gas fields and
also has an inventory of domestic and foreign drillable
prospects.

     
United
States.  Amerada Hess
Corporation operates mainly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and
onshore in Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. During 2003, 21%
of the Corporations crude oil and natural gas liquids
production and 37% of its natural gas production were from
United States operations.

     
The table below sets forth the Corporations
average daily net production by area in the United States:

The Llano Field (AHC 50%) on Garden Banks Blocks
385 and 386 in the Gulf of Mexico is currently being developed
with initial net production expected in mid-2004 at an average
rate of 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Additional appraisal drilling is planned for the Shenzi prospect
(AHC 28%) on Green Canyon Block 654 in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. Further appraisal drilling is also planned for the
Tubular Bells discovery (AHC 20%) on Mississippi Canyon Block
725, also in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

     
At December 31, 2003, the Corporation has
interests in approximately 290 exploration blocks in the Gulf of
Mexico of which it operates 202. The Corporation has 910,000 net
undeveloped acres in the Gulf of Mexico.

     
United
Kingdom.  The
Corporations activities in the United Kingdom are
conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Amerada Hess Limited.
During 2003, 37% of the Corporations crude oil and natural
gas liquids production and 46% of its natural gas production
were from United Kingdom operations.

Development of the Clair Field (AHC 9.29%) is
proceeding and it is expected to begin production in 2005. The
Atlantic (AHC 25%) and Cromarty (AHC 90%) natural gas fields are
also being developed. These fields are expected to have combined
net production of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2006.

     
During 2003, Amerada Hess Limited exchanged its
25% shareholding interest in Premier Oil plc, for a 23% interest
in Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia.

     
Norway.  The
Corporations activities in Norway are conducted through
its wholly-owned Norwegian subsidiary, Amerada Hess Norge A/S.
Norwegian operations accounted for crude oil and natural gas
liquids production of 25,000 barrels per day in both 2003
and 2002. Natural gas production averaged 26,000 Mcf per
day in 2003 and 25,000 Mcf per day in 2002. Substantially
all of the Norwegian production is from the Corporations
28.09% interest in the Valhall Field. An enhanced-recovery
waterflood project for the Valhall Field has commenced with
water injection starting in the first quarter of 2004.

     
Denmark.  Amerada
Hess ApS, the Corporations wholly-owned Danish subsidiary,
operates the South Arne Field. Net crude oil production from the
Corporations 57.48% interest in the South Arne Field was
24,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2003 compared to 23,000
barrels of oil per day in 2002. Natural gas production was
29,000 Mcf and 37,000 Mcf of natural gas per day in
2003 and 2002, respectively.

     
Equatorial
Guinea. The Corporation has
interests in production sharing contracts covering three
offshore blocks, acquired in August 2001. Net crude oil
production from the Corporations 85% interest in the Ceiba
Field averaged 22,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2003
and 37,000 barrels per day in 2002. The results of an
appraisal drilling program are being incorporated into the
development plan for Northern Block G discoveries
(AHC 85%). It is anticipated that the development plan will
be submitted for government approval in the second quarter of
2004.

     
Malaysia 
Thailand. In 2003, the Corporation
exchanged its oil and gas assets in Colombia for an additional
25% interest in long-lived natural gas reserves in the joint
development area of Malaysia and Thailand, bringing the
Corporations interest to 50%. This production sharing
contract has a gas sales agreement for the sale of the first
phase of gas production. Construction of the buyers
pipeline commenced in the second half of 2003. First production
from the field is expected in mid-2005.

     
Algeria. The
Corporation has a 49% interest in a venture with the Algerian
national oil company that is redeveloping three oil fields. The
Corporations share of production averaged 19,000 and
15,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. A seismic program is underway and appraisal
drilling is planned on a 2003 discovery on an exploration block
in Algeria.

     
Gabon.
Amerada Hess Production Gabon, the Corporations 77.5%
owned Gabonese subsidiary, has a 10% interest in the Rabi Kounga
Field and interests in two other Gabonese fields. The
Corporations share of production averaged 11,000 net
barrels of crude oil per day in 2003 and 9,000 barrels per day
in 2002.

Indonesia.
Reflecting the sale of the Jabung production sharing contract,
net production in Indonesia amounted to 1,000 barrels of
crude oil per day in 2003 compared with 4,000 barrels per
day in 2002. During 2003, the Corporation acquired a 23%
interest in the Natuna Sea Block A production sharing contract
in exchange for its shares of Premier Oil plc. Consequently,
natural gas production in Indonesia increased to 11,000 Mcf per
day in 2003 from 6,000 Mcf per day in 2002. A natural gas
discovery in the Pangkah production sharing contract area is
being developed.

     
Thailand. The
Corporation has a 15% interest in the Pailin gas field offshore
Thailand. Net production from the Corporations interest
averaged 52,000 Mcf and 35,000 Mcf of natural gas per day in
2003 and 2002, respectively. Additional appraisal drilling is
planned in 2004 on an onshore discovery on Phu Horm Block E5N
(AHC 35%).

     
Azerbaijan.
The Corporation has a 2.72% interest in the AIOC Consortium in
the Caspian Sea. Net production from its interest averaged 2,000
barrels of crude oil per day in 2003 and 4,000 barrels per
day in 2002. Development of the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli
fields is continuing.


Refining and Marketing
     
Refining.  The
Corporation owns a 50% interest in the HOVENSA refining joint
venture in the United States Virgin Islands with a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In addition, it owns
and operates a refining facility in Port Reading, New Jersey.

     
HOVENSA.
HOVENSAs total crude runs amounted to 440,000 barrels
per day in 2003 and 361,000 barrels per day in 2002. The
fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA operated at the rates
of 142,000 and 116,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA commenced production in
August 2002. The unit operated at the rate of
53,000 barrels per day in 2003. The coker permits HOVENSA
to run lower-cost heavy crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term
supply contract with PDVSA to purchase 115,000 barrels per
day of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude oil. PDVSA also supplies
155,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Mesa crude oil to
HOVENSA under a long-term crude oil supply contract. The
remaining crude oil requirements are purchased mainly under
contracts of one year or less from third parties and through
spot purchases on the open market. After sales of refined
products by HOVENSA to third parties, the Corporation purchases
50% of HOVENSAs remaining production at market prices.

     
Port Reading
Facility.  The Corporation
owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey. This facility processes vacuum gas oil and
residual fuel oil. During 2003, the facility operated at a rate
of approximately 54,000 barrels per day and substantially
all of its production was gasoline and heating oil.

     
Marketing.  The
Corporation markets refined petroleum products on the East Coast
of the United States to the motoring public, wholesale
distributors, industrial and commercial users, other petroleum
companies, governmental agencies and public utilities. It also
markets natural gas to utilities and other industrial and
commercial customers. The Corporations energy marketing
activities include the sale of electricity. The Corporation has
a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades
energy commodities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes
trading positions for its own account.

     
The Corporation has 1,195 HESS® gasoline
stations at December 31, 2003, of which approximately 68%
are company operated. In early 2004, a 50% owned joint venture
acquired a chain of gasoline stations, adding approximately
50 HESS® retail outlets. Most of the
Corporations gasoline stations are concentrated in densely
populated areas, principally in New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts and North and South
Carolina, and 856 gasoline stations have convenience stores. The
Corporation owns approximately 50% of the properties on which
the stations are located.

     
The Corporation has 22 terminals with an
aggregate storage capacity of 21 million barrels in its
East Coast marketing areas.

     
Refined product sales averaged
419,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 383,000 barrels
per day in 2002. Of total refined products sold in 2003,
approximately 50% was obtained from HOVENSA and Port Reading. The

Table of Contents

Corporation purchased the balance from others
under short-term supply contracts and by spot purchases from
various sources.


     
The Corporation has a wholly-owned subsidiary
that provides distributed electricity generating equipment to
industrial and commercial customers as an alternative to
purchasing electricity from local utilities. The Corporation
also has invested in long-term technology to develop fuel cells
for electricity generation through a venture with other parties.


Competition and Market Conditions
     
The petroleum industry is highly competitive. The
Corporation encounters competition from numerous companies in
each of its activities, particularly in acquiring rights to
explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and
marketing of refined products and natural gas. Many competitors
are larger and have substantially greater resources than the
Corporation. The Corporation is also in competition with
producers and marketers of other forms of energy.

     
The petroleum business involves large-scale
capital expenditures and risk-taking. In the search for new oil
and gas reserves, long lead times are often required from
successful exploration to subsequent production. Operations in
the petroleum industry depend on a depleting natural resource.
The number of areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons
will be discovered in commercial quantities is constantly
diminishing and exploration risks are high. Areas where
hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or
offshore where exploration and development activities are
capital intensive and operating costs are high.

     
The major foreign oil producing countries,
including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over
the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum
products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy
on rates of production and other matters has a significant
impact on oil markets and the Corporation. The derivatives
markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of
crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The Corporation
cannot predict the extent to which future market conditions may
be affected by foreign oil producing countries, the derivatives
markets or other external influences.


Other Items
     
The Corporations operations may be affected
by federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and
regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax
claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract
rights, and changes in import regulations, as well as other
political developments. The Corporation has been affected by
certain of these events in various countries in which it
operates. The Corporation markets motor fuels through
lessee-dealers and wholesalers in certain states where
legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from
directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar
legislation has been periodically proposed in the U.S. Congress
and in various other states. The Corporation, at this time,
cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future
operations.

     
Compliance with various existing environmental
and pollution control regulations imposed by federal, state and
local governments is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Corporations earnings and competitive
position within the industry. The Corporation spent
$12 million in 2003 for environmental remediation, with a
comparable amount anticipated for 2004. Capital expenditures for
facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local
environmental standards, were $7 million in 2003 and the
Corporation anticipates approximately $10 million in 2004.
Regulatory changes already made or anticipated in the United
States will alter the composition and emissions characteristics
of motor fuels. Future capital expenditures necessary to comply
with these regulations will be substantial. The Environmental
Protection Agency has adopted rules that limit the amount of
sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel. These rules phase in
beginning in 2004. Capital expenditures necessary to comply with
the low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading are
estimated to be approximately $70 million over the next
several years. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are currently
expected to be approximately $450 million over the next
three years. HOVENSA expects to finance these capital
expenditures through cash flow and, if necessary, future
borrowings.

Item 2. Properties
     
Reference is made to Item 1 and the operating and
financial information relating to the business and properties of
the Corporation which is incorporated in Item 1 by reference.

     
Additional information relating to the
Corporations oil and gas operations follows:


1. Oil and gas reserves
     
The Corporations net proved oil and gas
reserves at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001 are presented under
Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in the accompanying 2003 Annual
Report to Stockholders, which has been incorporated herein by
reference.

     
During 2003, the Corporation provided oil and gas
reserve estimates for 2002 to the Department of Energy. Such
estimates are compatible with the information furnished to the
SEC on Form 10-K, although not necessarily directly comparable
due to the requirements of the individual requests. There were
no differences in excess of 5%.

     
The Corporation has no contracts or agreements to
sell fixed quantities of its crude oil production, although
derivative instruments are used to reduce the effects of changes
in selling prices. In the United States, natural gas is sold to
local distribution companies, and commercial, industrial, and
other purchasers, on a spot basis and under contracts for
varying periods. The Corporations United States production
is expected to approximate 45% of its 2004 sales commitments
under long-term contracts which total approximately
355,000 Mcf per day. Natural gas sales commitments for 2005
are expected to be comparable. The Corporation attempts to
minimize price and supply risks associated with its United
States natural gas supply commitments by entering into purchase
contracts with third parties having adequate sources of supply,
on terms substantially similar to those under its commitments.

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

     
Purported class actions consolidated under the
complaint captioned In re Amerada Hess Corporation Securities
Litigation are pending in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey, against certain executive
officers and former executive officers of the Registrant
alleging that these individuals sold shares of Registrants
common stock in advance of Registrants acquisition of
Triton Energy Limited (Triton) in 2001 in violation
of federal securities laws. In addition, derivative actions
seeking damages on behalf of the Registrant and consolidated
under a complaint captioned In re Amerada Hess Derivative
Action are pending in the Superior Court of the State of New
Jersey against certain executive officers and former executive
officers of the Registrant, some of whom are also directors,
alleging, among other things, that the

9



Table of Contents

officers breached their fiduciary duties by
misusing material non-public information of the Registrant to
personally profit from the sale of the Registrants common
stock in connection with the Triton acquisition. Two other
purported class actions, based in large part on the same factual
background, were commenced in May and August 2003 and were
consolidated under a complaint captioned Falk et. al. v.
Amerada Hess Corporation, et. al. in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey against certain
named executive officers, certain directors and former directors
and certain employees of Registrant on behalf of participants in
the Registrants savings and stock bonus plan, alleging
that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, resulting in losses to
participants in the plan who held shares of the
Registrants common stock. The Registrant believes that
these actions are without merit and is advancing expenses to
these individuals in accordance with its By-Laws to defend these
actions. Based on current legal and factual circumstances,
Registrant does not believe these actions will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition.


     
Registrant has been served with a complaint from
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC) relating to alleged violations at its
petroleum terminal in Brooklyn, New York. The complaint, which
seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in
unspecified amounts, alleges violations involving the structural
integrity of certain tanks, the erosion of shorelines and
bulkheads, petroleum discharges and improper certification of
tank repairs. DEC is also seeking relief relating to remediation
of certain gasoline stations in the New York metropolitan area.
Registrant believes that many of the allegations are factually
inaccurate or based on an incorrect interpretation of applicable
law. Registrant has already undertaken efforts to address
certain conditions discussed in the complaint. Registrant
intends to vigorously contest the complaint, but is involved in
settlement discussions with DEC.

     
Over the last five years, many refiners have
entered into consent agreements to resolve EPAs assertions
that refining facilities were modified or expanded without
complying with New Source Review regulations that require
permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and
other regulations which impose emissions control requirements.
These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement
initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have
typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and
required significant capital expenditures to install emissions
control equipment. EPA contacted Registrant and HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), its 50% owned joint venture with Petroleos de
Venezuela, regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in
August, 2003 and held an initial meeting in October 2003. While
EPA has not made any specific assertions that the Registrant or
HOVENSA violated the New Source Review regulations, the
Registrant and HOVENSA expect to have further discussions with
EPA regarding the petroleum refining initiative.

     
In June 2001, the Corporation voluntarily
investigated and disclosed to the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection (NJDEP) that there was a calculation
error in the program code of the Port Reading refining
facilitys Wet Gas Scrubber (WGS) Continuous Emissions
Monitoring System (CEMS). The error in the code resulted in the
CEM system under calculating CO, NOx and SO2
emissions from the WGS beginning in late 1998 and some
exceedances of the permit limits for NOx. After discovery, the
code error was promptly corrected. In November 2003, the
Corporation received a notice of violation from the NJDEP
relating to the CEM coding error which proposes a fine of
$649,600. The Corporation is engaging in settlement discussions
with NJDEP to resolve this matter, particularly as regards to a
reduction in the penalty to reflect the voluntary self
disclosure of issue.

     
The Registrant, along with other companies
engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party
to lawsuits and claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially
identical lawsuits, many involving water utilities or
governmental entities, have been recently filed in jurisdictions
across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum
refiners who produce gasoline containing MTBE, including
Registrant. The principal allegation is that gasoline containing
MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly
liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for
damage to groundwater resources and are required to take
remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the
environment of releases of MTBE. Additional property damage and
personal injury lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE
are expected. Prior class action product liability based
litigation involving MTBE in gasoline has been resolved without
a material effect on the Registrant. While the damages claimed
in these

10



Table of Contents

actions are substantial, Registrant has no reason
to believe, based on factual and legal circumstances currently
known to the Registrant, that these actions will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition. However, these
actions are in their preliminary stages, and the factual and
legal circumstances may change.


     
In April 2003 HOVENSA received a notice of
violation from the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and
Natural Resources (DPNR), relating to certain
alleged wastewater permit exceedances occurring in 2001 and 2002
at HOVENSA. The notice proposes a fine of $219,000 and requires
corrective actions to address the alleged violations. HOVENSA is
engaging in settlement discussions with DPNR to resolve this
matter.

     
The Registrant periodically receives notices from
EPA that it is a potential responsible party under
the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal
sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible
parties are jointly and severally liable. For certain sites,
EPAs claims or assertions of liability against the
Corporation relating to these sites have not been fully
developed. With respect to the remaining sites, EPAs
claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under
consideration, in all cases for amounts which are not material.
The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related
proceedings by private parties, on the business or accounts of
the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the
large number of other potentially responsible parties and the
speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not
expected to be material.

     
Registrant is one of approximately 40 companies
that have received a directive from the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection to remediate contamination in the
sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking
natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects
Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk
storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by Registrant.
EPA has also issued an order relating to the same contamination,
but has not named Registrant. The costs of remediation of the
Passaic River are preliminary, but NJDEP has estimated them at
approximately $900 million. Based on currently known facts and
circumstances, Registrant does not believe that this matter will
result in material liability because its terminal could not have
contributed contamination along most of the rivers length
and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest
concern in the river sediments, and because there are numerous
other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation
and damages.

     
The Corporation is from time to time involved in
other judicial and administrative proceedings, including
proceedings relating to other environmental matters. Although
the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained
at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the
Corporation, no such proceeding is required to be disclosed
under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In managements opinion, based upon currently
known facts and circumstances, such proceedings in the aggregate
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of the Corporation.

submitted to a vote of security holders through the solicitation
of proxies or otherwise.

2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

 

Our Exploration and Production efforts are focused on creating value for
shareholders by advancing our current development projects, appraising our
recent discoveries and growing our proved reserve base.


EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION


PRODUCTION
In 2003, Amerada Hess produced 373,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Production is expected to average 325,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day in
2004, reflecting asset sales and swaps
transacted in 2003.


In the Garden Banks area of the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, total
production exceeded 33,000 barrels of
oil equivalent per day in 2003. Conger
(AHC 37.5%) and Baldpate (AHC 50%) are
key operated assets in the area.


Onshore, Amerada Hess is the leading oil
producer in North Dakota. Through a
combination of horizontal and infill
drilling and stimulation technology,
production levels have been maintained at
approximately 22,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, for the last five
years.


In the Seminole San Andres unit in West
Texas, Amerada Hess is an industry
leader in using carbon dioxide injection
technology to increase oil recovery. The
carbon dioxide tertiary recovery project
that commenced in 1983 is one of the
most successful
recovery projects in the region.


In the North Sea, Amerada Hess has a
large production base including the
Valhall Field (AHC 28.09%) in Norway,
the South Arne Field (AHC 57.48%) in
Denmark, and the Beryl (AHC 22.22%) and
the Schiehallion (AHC 15.67%) fields in
the United Kingdom. In 2003, 55% of
global oil and gas production was from
the North Sea.


The Ceiba Field (AHC 85%), located in
Block G in Equatorial Guinea, is
responding favorably to water injection
and is expected to produce approximately
25,000 net barrels per day in 2004
compared to 22,000 barrels per day in
2003.


DEVELOPMENT
Amerada Hess is developing 12 new oil
and gas fields with new production
starting over the next three years.
These developments are expected to add
more than 100,000 barrels of oil
equivalent production per day by 2006.


First production from the Llano Field
(AHC 50%) on Garden Banks Blocks 385
and 386 in the Gulf of Mexico is
scheduled for mid-2004, with initial
net production expected to reach12,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day by
year end.


In Block A-18 (AHC 50%) of the Joint
Development Area between Malaysia and
Thailand, final approval of the buyers
pipeline and gas plant was secured and
construction commenced in the second half
of 2003. First production from the field
is expected during the second half of
2005.


In Algeria, net production from the
Gassi El Agreb redevelopment project
operated by SonaHess, a joint operating
company between Amerada Hess and
Sonatrach, was approximately 20,000
barrels per day in 2003, an increase of
more than 30% from 2002.

In the United Kingdom, first
production from the Clair Field (AHC
9.29%) is expected in 2005 and from
the Atlantic (AHC 25%) and Cromarty
(AHC 90%) gas fields in 2006. Combined
net production from these three fields
is expected to exceed 25,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day in 2006.


In the Norwegian North Sea, enhanced
recovery from the Valhall field (AHC
28.09%) has begun with flank development
wells coming onstream in 2003 and water
injection commencing in the first quarter
of 2004. The
Snohvit project (AHC 3.26%), in the
Barents Sea offshore Norway, will be
Europes first LNG export facility when
gas production and liquefaction begin by
2006.


In Equatorial Guinea, the results of an
extended appraisal drilling program are
being incorporated into the development
plan for the Northern Block G
discoveries (AHC 85%). It is anticipated
that the development plan will be
submitted for government approval in the
second quarter of 2004.


Development of the giant Azeri, Chirag
and Guneshli fields (AHC 2.72%), in
Azerbaijan, is on schedule. Net
production is currently 2,000 barrels of
oil equivalent per day, and is expected
to increase to over 25,000 barrels per
day by 2009.


EXPLORATION
Exploration is a key component of future
growth. Amerada Hess has a strong
position in the deep-water Gulf of
Mexico, with leasehold interests in 291
blocks and over 4,000 blocks of 3D
seismic coverage. In 2003, two key
discoveries were made in this area:






 
Successful appraisal drilling was
conducted at the 2002 Shenzi
discovery (AHC 28%), on Green Canyon
Block 654. The Shenzi-2 well,
located in 4,238 feet of water,
encountered about 500 feet of net
pay. Further appraisal drilling is
planned in 2004.


 



 
The Tubular Bells discovery well
(AHC 20%) in Mississippi Canyon
Block 725, located in 4,300 feet of
water, was drilled to a depth of
31,131 feet. The well encountered
190 feet of net oil pay. Further
appraisal drilling is planned in
late 2004.


In northeastern Thailand, a successful
appraisal well was drilled on Phu Horm
Block E5N (AHC 35%). A flow test was
completed with a stabilized gas rate of
31.5 million cubic feet per day.
Additional appraisal drilling is planned in 2004.


Amerada Hess made a new discovery on
Block 401c (AHC 60%), in Algeria. An
extensive seismic program is underway,
with more drilling scheduled for the
second half of 2004.

Refining and marketing continues to be an important profit and cash generator
for the Corporation, with growth
opportunities in both retail and energy marketing. In 2003, refining and
marketing achieved its best financial performance in 10 years.


REFINING & MARKETING


REFINING
The HOVENSA refinery in the United
States Virgin Islands is jointly owned
by the Corporation and Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA). It is one of the
largest refineries in the world. The
facility is strategically located in
the Caribbean, allowing for short crude
supply lines from Venezuela, as well as
easy access to U.S. Gulf and East Coast
product markets.


In 2003, the refinery successfully
completed the first year of operation of
a 58,000 barrel per day coking unit.
Gross crude runs at the refinery averaged
440,000 barrels per day for 2003, which,
combined with improved refining margins,
resulted in a significant improvement in
financial performance versus 2002.


The Corporations fluid catalytic
cracking unit in Port Reading, New
Jersey produces high-quality,
clean-burning gasoline for northeast
markets.


The facility averaged feedstock runs of
54,000 barrels per day and realized a
significant improvement in gasoline
margins over 2002.


Both refining facilities continue to
produce gasoline with specifications that
result in emissions well below the U.S.
national average.


MARKETING
Retail
The HESS retail network has become the
leading independent gasoline convenience
store marketer on the East Coast. In
2003, four new locations were built,
while 10 existing sites were upgraded
with the addition of HESS EXPRESS
convenience stores. HESS EXPRESS stores
generally feature several fast food
offerings and proprietary coffee/fountain
programs and are major destinations for
take-home bulk beverages. HESS EXPRESS
gasoline volumes and convenience store
sales are significantly higher than
industry averages.


12



 


In early 2004, WilcoHess, LLC, the
joint venture between Amerada Hess and
A.T. Williams Oil Company, completed
the acquisition of 50 retail facilities
from Service Distributing Company,
significantly strengthening our brand
position in the growing North Carolina
market. With that purchase, the total
number of Hess branded retail
facilities increased to approximately
1,250.


Energy Marketing
In energy marketing, the Corporation is
a major supplier of natural gas, fuel
oil and electricity, with more than
24,000 commercial and industrial
customer locations primarily on the East
Coast. Cold weather in the first quarter
of 2003 resulted in strong margins and
demand for fuel oil and natural gas,
significantly improving financial
results over 2002.


Supply & Terminals
The Corporation operates a network of
twenty-two strategically located
petroleum terminals on the East Coast of
the United States. In addition to supply
from our refining assets, a well-balanced
combination of term and spot supply
contracts provides the flexibility to
manage product inventories effectively
across the network. In 2003, the
Corporation was able to leverage our
network to provide customers superior
reliability of supply during the
unusually cold winter weather.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Amerada Hess Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries



Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition
Executive Overview
The Corporation is a global integrated
energy company that operates in two
segments, exploration and production (E&P)
and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P
segment explores for, produces and sells
crude oil and natural gas. The R&M segment
manufactures, trades and markets refined
petroleum and other energy products.


The Corporations long-term goal for the
E&P segment is to generate profitable and
sustainable growth by transitioning the
asset portfolio to longer life, lower cost
fields, bringing new field developments
onstream and pursuing a focused, high
impact exploration program. During the past
three years the Corporation has reshaped
its E&P asset portfolio by:







 
Acquiring exploration,
development and production assets
in West Africa and Southeast
Asia.






 
Selling higher cost properties
predominantly in the shallow water
Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea.






 
Exchanging interests in mature
producing assets for increased
interests in development stage
assets in the joint development
area of Malaysia and Thailand and
deepwater Gulf of Mexico.


The asset sales and exchanges have reduced
near-term production which increased unit
operating costs. Production declined from
451,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
in 2002 to 373,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2003. Over 60% of the
reduction resulted from the absence of
production from assets sold or exchanged.
The remainder of the decrease was due to
natural declines and poorer than expected
performance of certain fields in the United
States and Equatorial Guinea. Production is
expected to decline in 2004 by
approximately 13% due to the 2003 asset
sales and swaps and natural declines in our
remaining fields.


The Corporation is currently funding twelve
development projects that are expected to
provide over 100,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day of new production in
2006, offsetting natural declines in
existing fields and providing net overall
production growth. In addition, since 2002,
the Corporation has participated in two
deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries that
may provide additional production beyond
2006. As a result of the development
projects, the Corporation presently
estimates that production will be slightly
higher in 2005 than in 2004 and production
will increase further in 2006. While
the Corporation expects these developments
to be completed as currently scheduled,
development projects may be subject to
unforeseen events, such as technical
complexities, delays in governmental
sanction and political instability.


The lower production in 2004 is not
expected to result in higher 2004 unit
operating costs due to cost reduction
initiatives begun in 2003 and the
portfolio rationalization. The
Corporation believes these factors, plus
increasing production from new
developments, will reduce unit costs in
the future.


The portfolio reshaping has reduced
near-term cash flows from operations. In
response, the Corporation has hedged
approximately 70% and 45% of its 2004 and
2005 worldwide crude oil production to
provide secure cash flow to fund the
development projects. Upon completion of
the projects, the Corporation expects the
percentage of hedged volumes to decrease.


The R&M segments financial results
improved significantly in 2003,
principally reflecting higher margins and
increased sales volumes. The Corporations
strategic goals for R&M are to maximize
financial returns from existing assets and
to generate free cash flow. The
Corporation may opportunistically add
retail marketing sites in its East Coast
marketing area.


The Corporations liquidity and financial
position were significantly improved in
2003. At December 31, 2002, the
Corporations debt was $5 billion and its
debt to capitalization ratio was 54%.
During 2003, the Corporation generated cash
flow of $545 million from asset sales and
$653 million from the issuance of mandatory
convertible preferred stock. These actions,
combined with additional free cash flow
from profitable operations after funding
capital expenditures, resulted in debt
reduction of $1.1 billion. Year-end debt
was $3.9 billion and the debt to
capitalization ratio improved to 42.5%. The
Corporation has $221 million of debt
maturities over the next three years, and
had $518 million of cash on hand at
December 31, 2003.

In the discussion which follows, the
financial effects of certain transactions
are disclosed on an after-tax basis.
Management reviews segment earnings on an
after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts
in its review of variances in segment
earnings. Management believes that
after-tax amounts are a preferable method
of explaining variances in earnings, since
they show the entire effect of a
transaction rather than only the pre-tax
amount. After-tax amounts are determined by
applying the appropriate income tax rate in
each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.


The following items, on an after-tax basis,
are included in income from continuing
operations for the years 2003, 2002 and
2001:

The items in the table above are explained
on pages 18, 19 and 20. The pre-tax amounts
are shown on pages 18 and 20.



Comparison of Results
Exploration and Production: After
considering the exploration and production
items in the preceding table (described on
page 18), the remaining changes in
exploration and production earnings are
primarily attributable to changes in
selling prices, production volumes and
operating costs and exploration expenses,
as discussed below.



     Selling prices: Higher average selling
prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids
and natural gas increased exploration and
production revenues from continuing
operations by approximately $170 million in
2003 compared with 2002. In 2002, the
change in average selling prices did not
significantly affect revenues compared with
2001. The Corporations average selling
prices from continuing operations,
including the effects of hedging, were as
follows:

     Production volumes: Lower crude oil
and natural gas production volumes reduced
exploration and production revenues from
continuing operations in 2003 compared with
2002 by $425 million. In 2002, crude oil
production was higher than in 2001 and
natural gas production was lower. The net
effect of these volume changes was an
increase in revenues of $100 million. The
Corporations net daily worldwide
production was as follows:

Reflects natural gas production
converted on the basis of relative
energy content (six Mcf equals one
barrel).


The Corporations oil and gas production,
on a barrel of oil equivalent basis,
decreased to 373,000 barrels per day in
2003 from 451,000 barrels per day in 2002.
Approximately 60% of this decline was due
to asset sales and exchanges. The remainder
was principally due to natural decline,
disappointing results from fields acquired
in the United States in 2001 and reduced
production from the Ceiba Field in
Equatorial Guinea. The Corporation
anticipates that its 2004 production will
be approximately 13% below 2003 production
of 373,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day. Approximately 16,000 barrels per day
of the expected decrease is due to asset
sales and exchanges in 2003 and the
remainder is principally due to natural
decline.



     Operating costs and exploration
expenses: Operating costs and exploration
expenses from continuing operations
increased by approximately $70 million and
$330 million in 2003 and 2002 compared
with the corresponding amounts in the
prior years.

Production expenses increased in 2003
primarily due to the weakening of the U.S.
dollar, which increased costs incurred in
foreign currencies and resulted in higher
expenses than in prior years. Production
expenses in 2003 also reflect higher
employee benefit, transportation and
maintenance costs. Production expenses in
2002 were higher than in 2001 due to
increased production from higher cost
fields, workovers and other maintenance,
and higher production volumes.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization
charges were lower in 2003 than in 2002,
reflecting decreased production volumes and
lower depreciable costs resulting from
impairments in 2002. Depreciation and
related charges were higher in 2002
compared to 2001, due to higher unit costs
from amortization of the purchase prices of
fields in Equatorial Guinea, Colombia and
the United States and increased production
volumes. Exploration expense was higher in
2003, reflecting increased activity in the
United States and Equatorial Guinea, as
well as additional lease cost amortization.
Exploration expense decreased in 2002
compared with 2001, principally reflecting
improved drilling results.


The Corporations total unit cost per
barrel of oil equivalent produced
increased in 2003 and 2002 compared with
2001. Unit cost per barrel includes
production expense, depreciation,
depletion and amortization, exploration
expense and administrative costs. Unit
costs per barrel totaled $17.32 in 2003,
$15.11 in 2002 and $13.11 in 2001. The
Corporation estimates that its 2004 unit
costs will approximate the 2003 amount.



     Other: After-tax foreign currency
losses amounted to $22 million ($4
million before income taxes) in 2003
compared with income of $6 million ($26
million before income taxes) in 2002 and
a loss of $17 million ($21 million before
income taxes) in 2001.

The effective income tax rate for
exploration and production operations in
2003 was 51%. This includes income taxes
paid in jurisdictions with rates in excess
of the United States statutory rate in
several producing areas, such as the United
Kingdom and Norway. It also reflects an
income tax deduction for the Corporations
hedging results at the U.S. statutory rate.
In addition, certain expenses in foreign
jurisdictions are benefited at rates equal
to or below the U.S. statutory rate. Each
of these factors increases the
Corporations overall exploration and
production effective income tax rate.
During 2002, the United Kingdom government
enacted a 10% supplementary tax on profits
from oil and gas production. The effect of
this supplementary tax was an increase in
exploration and production income taxes of
approximately $60 million in 2003 and $37
million in 2002. The effective income tax
rate for exploration and production
operations in 2004 is expected to be in the
range of 47% to 51%.

continuing operations include the following

2003: The Corporation recorded an after-tax
charge of $32 million for accrued severance
in the United States and United Kingdom and
a reduction of leased office space in
London. The pre-tax amount of this charge
was $53 million, of which $32 million
relates to leased office space. The
remainder of $21 million relates to
severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston.
Over 700 employee and contractor positions
have been or will be eliminated.
Approximately 240 employees are receiving
severance, $15 million of which has been
paid through year-end. The remainder is
expected to be paid in 2004. Additional
accruals for severance and lease costs of
approximately $15 million before income
taxes are anticipated in the first half of
2004. The annual savings from this cost
reduction initiative is estimated to be
approximately $50 million before income
taxes. The Corporation anticipates
realizing approximately sixty percent of
these savings in 2004 and the full amount
in 2005.


The Corporation recorded an income tax
benefit of $30 million reflecting the
recognition for United States income tax
purposes of certain prior year foreign
exploration expenses. Gains from asset
sales in 2003 reflect $31 million ($47
million before income taxes) from the sale
of the Corporations 1.5% interest in the
Trans Alaska Pipeline System.


2002: Exploration and production earnings
included after-tax asset impairments of
$737 million ($1,024 million before income
taxes), $530 million of which related to
the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. The
pre-tax amount of the Ceiba Field
impairment was $706 million. The charge
resulted from a 12% reduction in the
estimated total field reserves that will
ultimately be produced from the field, as
well as higher anticipated development
costs needed to produce the remaining
reserves at lower production rates over a
longer time frame.


The amount of Ceiba Field proved reserves
was about the same at the end of 2002 as
the amount at the beginning of the year
(excluding 2002 production) and,
therefore, the 12% reduction in total
field reserves resulted from a decrease in
probable reserves. The net proved reserves
did not change in 2002 as a result of the
recognition of a more efficient primary
recovery factor than previously estimated,
and to a lesser extent the positive impact
of the initiation of water injection
operations in February 2002 to maintain
reservoir pressure, and additional
drilling.



18



 

The reduction in estimated recoverable
reserves was attributable to disappointing
2002 year-end drilling results on the
western flank of the field. The reduction
in probable reserves and higher estimated
future development costs resulted in an
asset impairment because projected
discounted cash flows were less than the
book value of the field, which includes
allocated purchase price from the Triton
acquisition.


The Corporation also recorded an after-tax
impairment charge of $207 million ($318
million before income taxes) to reduce the
carrying value of oil and gas properties
located primarily in the Main Pass/Breton
Sound area of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of
these properties were obtained in the 2001
LLOG acquisition and consisted of producing
oil and gas fields with proved and probable
reserves and exploration acreage. This
charge principally reflects reduced reserve
estimates on these fields resulting from
unfavorable production performance. The
fair values of producing properties were
determined by using discounted cash flows.
Exploration properties were evaluated by
using results of drilling and production
data from nearby fields and seismic data
for these and other properties in the area.


During 2002, the United Kingdom government
enacted a 10% supplementary tax on profits
from oil and gas production. A one-time
charge of $43 million was recorded to
increase the existing United Kingdom
deferred tax liability on the balance
sheet.


A net gain of $34 million ($41 million
before income taxes) was recorded during
2002 from sales of oil and gas producing
properties in the United States, United
Kingdom and Azerbaijan, and the
Corporations energy marketing business in
the United Kingdom.


2001: The Corporation recorded an after-tax
charge of $19 million ($29 million before
income taxes) for estimated losses due to
the bankruptcy of certain subsidiaries of
Enron Corporation. In addition, the
Corporation recorded a net charge of $10
million ($15 million before income taxes)
for severance expenses resulting from cost
reduction initiatives.


The Corporations future exploration and
production earnings may be impacted by
volatility in the selling prices of crude
oil and natural gas, reserve and production
changes, fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates and changes in tax rates.


Refining and Marketing: Earnings from
refining and marketing activities amounted
to $327 million in 2003, $85 million in
2002 and $233 million in 2001. The
Corporations downstream operations
include HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint
venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), accounted for on
the equity method. Additional refining
and marketing activities include a fluid
catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail
gasoline stations, energy marketing and
trading operations.



     HOVENSA: The Corporations share of
HOVENSAs income was $117 million in
2003, compared with a loss of $47 million
in 2002 and income of $58 million in
2001. The increase in 2003 was due to
higher refining margins and sales volumes
compared with 2002. Crude runs were
reduced in 2002 as a result of low
refining margins and the shutdown of the
fluid catalytic cracking unit for
approximately two months. Income taxes on
the Corporations share of HOVENSAs
results were offset by available loss
carryforwards.

HOVENSAs total crude runs amounted to
440,000 barrels per day in 2003, 361,000
barrels per day in 2002 and 403,000 barrels
per day in 2001. In late 2002 and very
early 2003, crude oil deliveries to HOVENSA
were interrupted due to political
disturbances in Venezuela. For the
remainder of 2003, HOVENSA received
contracted quantities of crude oil from
PDVSA. The fluid catalytic cracking unit at
HOVENSA operated at 142,000, 116,000 and
123,000 barrels per day in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The coking unit at
HOVENSA commenced production in August
2002. The unit operated at the rate of
53,000 barrels per day in 2003.


Earnings from refining and marketing
activities also include interest income on
the note received from PDVSA at the
formation of the joint venture. Interest on
the PDVSA note amounted to $30 million in
2003, $35 million in 2002 and $39 million
in 2001. Interest income is reflected in
non-operating income in the income
statement.

     Retail, Energy Marketing and Other:
Earnings from retail gasoline operations
were higher in 2003 compared with 2002,
reflecting increased margins and sales
volumes. Retail gasoline operations in 2002
were profitable but less so than in 2001,
reflecting lower margins. Energy marketing
activities had increased earnings in 2003,
reflecting increased margins and sales
volumes in the early part of the year
resulting from the cold winter. Energy
marketing activities were profitable in
2002 compared with a loss in 2001. Results
of the Port Reading refining facility
improved in 2003 reflecting higher margins
than in 2002. Total refined product sales
volumes were 153 million barrels in 2003,
140 million barrels in 2002 and 141 million
barrels in 2001.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest
in a consolidated partnership that trades
energy commodities and energy derivatives.
The Corporation also takes trading
positions in addition to its hedging
program. The Corporations after-tax
results from trading activities, including
its share of the earnings of the trading
partnership amounted to income of $17
million in 2003, $3 million in 2002 and
$45 million in 2001. Before income taxes,
the trading income was $30 million in
2003, $6 million in 2002 and $72 million
in 2001.

In 2003, refining and marketing earnings
include a net loss of $20 million (loss of
$9 million before income taxes) from the
sale of the Corporations interest in a
shipping joint venture.


In 2002, the Corporation completed the
sale of six United States flag vessels for
$161 million in cash and a note for $29
million. The sale resulted in a net gain
of $67 million ($102 million before income
taxes). In connection with this sale, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyers
charter rate on these vessels for up to
five years. The support agreement requires
that if the actual contracted rate for the
charter of a vessel is less than the
stipulated support rate in the agreement
the Corporation will pay to the buyer the
difference between the contracted rate and
the stipulated rate. At January 1, 2003,
the charter support reserve was $48
million. During 2003, the Corporation paid
$5 million of charter support. Based on
contractual long-term charters entered
into in 2003, and estimates of future
charter rates, the Corporation lowered the
estimated charter support reserve by $11
million. The balance in this reserve at
December 31, 2003 was $32 million.


The Corporation recorded an after-tax
charge of $14 million ($22 million before
income taxes) in 2002 for the write-off of
intangible assets in its U.S. energy
marketing business. In addition, after-tax
accrued severance of $8 million ($13
million before income taxes) was recorded
for cost reduction initiatives in refining
and marketing, principally energy
marketing.


Refining and marketing earnings will likely
continue to be volatile reflecting
competitive industry conditions and supply
and demand factors, including the effects
of weather.


Corporate: After-tax corporate expenses
amounted to $101 million in 2003, $63
million in 2002 and $78 million in 2001.
The 2003 amount includes expenses of $34
million for premiums paid on the repurchase
of bonds compared with $6 million in 2002.
The pre-tax amounts of the bond repurchase
premiums were $58 million in 2003 and $15
million in 2002 and are recorded in
non-operating income (expense) in the
income statement. Corporate administrative
expenses, before income taxes, increased
slightly in 2003 and were comparable in
2002 and 2001. The decrease in after-tax
expenses in 2002 reflects lower United
States taxes on foreign source income.
After-tax corporate expenses for 2004 are
estimated to be in the range of $60 to $70
million.



20



 

Interest: After-tax interest was $173
million in 2003, $165 million in 2002 and
$135 million in 2001. The corresponding
amounts before income taxes were $293
million, $256 million and $194 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest
incurred in 2003 was lower than in 2002
because of debt reduction; however, the
reduction in interest incurred was more
than offset by lower capitalized interest
in 2003. Capitalized interest in 2003, 2002
and 2001 was $41 million, $101 million and
$44 million, respectively. Interest expense
was higher in 2002 compared with 2001
reflecting increased borrowings related to
acquisitions. After-tax interest expense in
2004 is anticipated to be approximately 20%
below the 2003 level.


Discontinued Operations: In the first
quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged
its crude oil producing properties in
Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the
Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in
cash, for an additional 25% interest in
Block A-18 in the joint development area
of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA). The
exchange resulted in an after-tax charge
to income of $47 million ($51 million
before income taxes). The after-tax loss
on this exchange included a $43 million
adjustment of the book value of the
Colombian assets to fair value. The loss
also included $17 million from the
recognition in earnings of the value of
related hedge contracts at the time of the
exchange. These items were partially
offset by after-tax earnings in Colombia
prior to the exchange of $13 million. The
JDA production facilities are complete,
but production will not commence until the
purchasers of the gas complete the
construction of a natural gas pipeline.
The Corporation anticipates that
production will begin in the second half
of 2005.


In the second quarter of 2003, the
Corporation sold Gulf of Mexico shelf
properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia
and several small United Kingdom fields
for $445 million. The after-tax gain from
these asset sales of $175 million ($248
million before income taxes) was included
in discontinued operations. Discontinued
operations in 2003 also includes $40
million of income from operations prior to
the sales of these assets.


Change in Accounting Principle: The
Corporation adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective
January 1, 2003. A net after-tax gain of $7
million resulting from the cumulative
effect of this accounting change was
recorded at the beginning of the year. At
the date of adoption, a liability of $556
million representing the estimated fair
value of the Corporations required
dismantlement obligations was recorded on
the balance sheet. In addition, a
dismantlement asset of $311 million was
recorded, as well as accumulated
depreciation of $203 million.


Sales and Other Operating Revenues: In
2003, sales and other operating revenues
increased by 24% compared with 2002. This
increase principally reflects increased
sales volumes and selling prices of
refined products and the higher selling
price of purchased natural gas in energy
marketing activities. Sales and other
operating revenues decreased by 12% in
2002 compared with 2001, due to the sale
of the United Kingdom energy marketing
business, and lower sales volumes of
refined products and purchased natural gas
related to U.S. energy marketing. These
decreases were partially offset by higher
production of crude oil and natural gas.
The change in cost of goods sold in each
year reflects the change in sales of
refined products and purchased natural gas.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
     Overview: Cash flows from operating
activities, including changes in operating
assets and liabilities, totaled $1,581
million in 2003. During the year, the
Corporation strengthened its financial
position through sales of assets and the
issuance of preferred stock. At December
31, 2003, the Corporations debt to
capitalization ratio was 42.5% compared to
54.0% at December 31, 2002. Total debt was
$3,941 million at December 31, 2003 and
$4,992 million at December 31, 2002. Cash
and cash equivalents at the end of 2003
totaled $518 million, an increase of $321
million for the year. Long-term debt
totaling $221 million matures over the next
three years.

The Corporation has hedged the selling
prices of a significant portion of its
crude oil and natural gas production in
2004 and 2005 to help generate a level of
cash flow that will meet operating and
capital commitments.



21



 

     Cash Flows from Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities,
including changes in operating assets and
liabilities, totaled $1,581 million in
2003, $1,965 million in 2002 and $1,960
million in 2001. Lower cash flows in 2003
were primarily due to reduced exploration
and production sales volumes.

Capital expenditures in 2001 included
$2,720 million for the Triton acquisition,
excluding the assumption of debt. In
addition, the Corporation purchased crude
oil and natural gas reserves in the Gulf
of Mexico and onshore Louisiana for $920
million. The amounts shown for
acquisitions in 2002 principally represent
final installment payments on prior year
acquisitions.


In 2003, the Corporation took initiatives
to reshape its portfolio of producing
assets to reduce future costs, increase its
reserve to production ratio, and provide
capital for investment in new fields and
funds to reduce debt. The Corporation sold
certain producing properties in the Gulf of
Mexico Shelf, the Jabung Field in
Indonesia, several small United Kingdom
fields and an interest in a shipping joint
venture. Proceeds from asset sales totaled
$545 million during 2003. In addition, the
Corporation completed several asset exchanges. The Corporation
swapped mature, high-cost assets in
Colombia for an additional 25% interest in
long-lived natural gas reserves in Block
A-18 in the joint development area of
Malaysia and Thailand, bringing the
Corporations interest in the area to 50%.
The Corporation exchanged its 25% equity
investment in Premier Oil plc for a 23%
interest in Natuna Sea Block A in
Indonesia, plus approximately $10 million
in cash. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Corporation exchanged 14% interests in the
Scott and Telford fields in the United
Kingdom for an additional 22.5% interest in
the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and
$17 million in cash. This exchange
increased the Corporations working
interest in the Llano Field to 50% and
decreased its interest in the Scott Field
to 21% and the Telford Field to 17%.
Production from the Corporations 50%
interest in the Llano Field is scheduled to
commence in mid-2004.


The net production from fields sold or
exchanged at the time of disposition was
approximately 50,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day. The Corporation
believes the overall impact of its program
of asset exchanges and sales of properties
has not reduced its liquidity in the
short-term or over the next five years.


In 2002, the Corporation sold United
States Flag vessels, its energy marketing
business in the United Kingdom and several
small oil and gas fields for net proceeds
of $412 million.



     Cash Flows from Financing Activities:
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Corporation issued 13,500,000 shares of
mandatory convertible preferred stock for
net proceeds of $653 million. Cash flows
from operations, asset sales and the
issuance of preferred stock enabled the
Corporation to reduce debt by $1,051
million during 2003. Debt repayment in
2002, net of new borrowings, was $673
million.


22



 

     Future Capital Requirements and
Resources: Capital expenditures in 2004 are
expected to be approximately $1.5 billion.
The Corporation anticipates that these
expenditures will be funded by available
cash and cash flow from operations. Lines
of credit are available, if necessary. At
December 31, 2003, the Corporation has an
undrawn facility of $1.5 billion under its
committed revolving credit agreement and
has additional unused lines of credit of
$206 million under uncommitted arrangements
with banks. The Corporations revolving
credit agreement expires in 2006 and the
Corporation expects it will be able to
arrange a new committed facility at that
time, if required. The Corporation also has
a shelf registration under which it may
issue $825 million of additional debt
securities, warrants, common stock or
preferred stock.


     Loan agreement covenants allow the
Corporation to borrow an additional $5
billion for the construction or acquisition
of assets at December 31, 2003. At year
end, the amount that can be borrowed under
the loan agreements for the payment of
dividends is $1.9 billion.


     The Corporations aggregate
maturities of long-term debt total $221
million over the next three years. Based
on current estimates of production,
capital expenditures and other factors,
and assuming West Texas Intermediate oil
prices average $24 per barrel and United
States natural gas prices average $4.25
per Mcf, the Corporation anticipates it
will fund its future operations, including
capital expenditures, dividends and
required debt repayment, with existing
cash on-hand, cash flow from operations
and, when necessary, borrowings under its
credit facilities and the issuance of
securities under its shelf registration.


     Prior to June 30, 1986, the
Corporation had extensive exploration and
production operations in Libya, however, it
was required to suspend participation in
these operations as a result of U.S.
government sanctions. If U.S. sanctions on
Libya are removed, and if the Corporation
and its partners successfully negotiate
with the government of Libya to resume
participation in the groups former
operations, management anticipates capital
expenditures will likely increase over the
current plan. Production and reserves would
also increase. On February 24, 2004, the
Corporation received U.S. Government
authorization to negotiate and enter into
an executory agreement with the government
of Libya that would define the terms for
resuming active participation in the
Libyan properties. The Corporations
performance under this agreement will be
contingent on obtaining future U.S.
Government authorizations. The Corporation
cannot predict the outcome or timing of
these events.


     Credit Ratings: While the Corporation
maintains investment grade ratings from two
rating agencies, one credit rating agency
downgraded its rating of the Corporations
debt to non-investment grade in February
2004. Cash margin or collateral is required
under certain contracts with hedging and
trading counterparties and certain lenders.
The amount of such cash margin or
collateral would have increased at December
31, 2003 by approximately $230 million as a
result of the downgrade. The downgrade is
expected to increase annual pre-tax
financing costs by less than $10 million.

*The Corporation intends to continue
purchasing its refined product supply
from HOVENSA. Current purchases amount
to approximately $2 billion annually.



23




 

In the preceding table, the Corporations
supply commitments include its estimated
purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of
refined products, after anticipated sales
by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Also
included are normal term purchase
agreements at market prices for additional
gasoline necessary to supply the
Corporations retail marketing system and
feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
facility. In addition, the Corporation has
commitments to purchase natural gas for use
in supplying contracted customers in its
energy marketing business. These
commitments were computed based on year-end
market prices.


The table also reflects that portion of the
Corporations planned capital expenditures
that are contractually committed at
December 31. The Corporations 2004 capital
expenditures are estimated to be
approximately $1.5 billion, including
approximately $900 million for oil and gas
developments. Obligations for operating
expenses include commitments for
transportation, seismic purchases, oil and
gas production expenses and other normal
business expenses. Other long-term
liabilities reflect contractually committed
obligations on the balance sheet at
December 31, including minimum pension plan
funding requirements.


In connection with the sale of six vessels
in 2002, the Corporation agreed to support
the buyers charter rate on these vessels
for up to five years. The support agreement
requires that if the actual contracted rate
for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the
agreement, the Corporation will pay to the
buyer the difference between the contracted
rate and the stipulated rate. The balance
in the charter support reserve at December
31, 2003 was $32 million.


The Corporation has a contingent purchase
obligation to acquire the remaining 50%
interest in a retail marketing and
gasoline station joint venture for $88
million.


The Corporation guarantees the payment of
up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases
from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount
of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates
based on the volume of crude oil purchased
and related prices and at December 31, 2003
amounted to $134 million.


In addition, the Corporation has agreed
to provide funding up to a maximum of $40
million to the extent HOVENSA does not
have funds to meet its senior debt
obligations.


At December 31, the Corporation is
contingently liable under letters of credit
and under guarantees of the debt of other
entities directly related to its business,
as follows:

for a natural gas pipeline in which the
Corporation owns a 5% interest.


     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The
Corporation has leveraged lease financings not
included in its balance sheet, primarily
related to retail gasoline stations that
the Corporation operates. The net present
value of these financings is $462 million
at December 31, 2003, using interest
rates inherent in the leases. The
Corporations December 31, 2003 debt to
capitalization ratio would increase from
42.5% to 45.2% if the lease financings
were included.

See also Contractual Obligations and
Contingencies above, Note No. 7,
Refining Joint Venture, and Note No.
18, Guarantees and Contingencies, in
the financial statements.



     Foreign Operations: The Corporation
conducts exploration and production
activities in many foreign countries,
including the United Kingdom, Norway,
Denmark, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand,
Azerbaijan, Algeria, Malaysia and
Equatorial Guinea. Therefore, the
Corporation is subject to the risks
associated with foreign operations. These
exposures include political risk
(including tax law changes) and currency
risk. The effects of these events are
accounted for when they occur and
generally have not been material to the
Corporations liquidity or financial
position.

HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the
Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de
Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates
a refinery in the Virgin Islands. Although
there have in the past been political
disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the
availability of Venezuelan crude oil used
in refining operations, these disruptions
did not have a material adverse effect on
the Corporations financial position. The
Corporation also has a note receivable of
$334 million at December 31, 2003 from a
subsidiary of PDVSA. The Corporation
anticipates collection of the remaining
balance.



Market Risk Disclosure
In the normal course of its business, the
Corporation is exposed to commodity risks
related to changes in the price of crude
oil, natural gas, refined products and
electricity, as well as to changes in
interest rates and foreign currency values.
In the disclosures which follow, these
operations are referred to as non-trading
activities. The Corporation also has
trading operations, principally through a
50% voting interest in a trading
partnership. These activities are also
exposed to commodity risks primarily
related to the prices of crude oil, natural
gas and refined products. The following
describes how these risks are controlled
and managed.



     Controls: The Corporation maintains a
control environment under the direction of
its chief risk officer and through its
corporate risk policy, which the
Corporations senior management has
approved. Controls include volumetric,
term and value-at-risk limits. In
addition, the chief risk officer must
approve the use of new instruments or
commodities. Risk limits are monitored
daily and exceptions are reported to
business units and to senior management.
The Corporations risk management
department also performs independent
verifications of sources of fair values
and validations of valuation models. These
controls apply to all of the Corporations
non-trading and trading activities, including the
consolidated trading partnership. The
Corporations treasury department
administers foreign exchange rate and
interest rate hedging programs.


     Instruments: The Corporation uses
forward commodity contracts, foreign
exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps
and options in the Corporations
non-trading and trading activities. These
contracts are widely traded instruments
mainly with standardized terms. The
following describes these instruments and
how the Corporation uses them:






 





 
Forward Commodity Contracts: The
forward purchase and sale of
commodities is performed as part of
the Corporations normal activities.
At title date, the notional value of
the contract is exchanged for physical
delivery of the commodity. Forward
contracts that are designated as
normal purchase and sale contracts
under FAS No. 133 are excluded from
the quantitative market risk
disclosures.






 
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:
Forward contracts include forward
purchase contracts for both the
British pound sterling and the Danish
kroner. These foreign currency
contracts commit the Corporation to
purchase a fixed amount of pound
sterling and kroner at a predetermined
exchange rate on a certain date.






 
Futures: The Corporation uses
exchange traded futures contracts on
a number of different underlying
energy commodities. These contracts
are settled daily with the relevant
exchange and are subject to exchange
position limits.






 
Swaps: The Corporation uses
financially settled swap contracts
with third parties as part of its
hedging and trading activities. Cash
flows from swap contracts are
determined based on underlying
commodity prices and are typically
settled over the life of the
contract.






 
Options: Options on various
underlying energy commodities include
exchange traded and third party
contracts and have various exercise
periods. As a seller of options, the
Corporation receives a premium at the
outset and bears the risk of
unfavorable changes in the price of
the commodity underlying the option.
As a purchaser of options, the
Corporation pays a premium at the
outset and has the right to
participate in the favorable price
movements in the underlying
commodities.


     Quantitative Measures: The Corporation
uses value-at-risk to monitor and control
commodity risk within its trading and
non-trading activities. The value-at-risk
model uses historical simulation and the
results represent the potential loss in
fair value over one day at a 95% confidence
level. The model captures both first and
second order sensitivities for options. The
potential change in fair value based on
commodity price risk is presented in the
non-trading and trading sections below.


25



 

For foreign exchange rate risk, the impact
of a 10% change in foreign exchange rates
on the value of the Corporations portfolio
of foreign currency forward contracts is
presented in the non-trading section.
Similarly, the impact of a 15% change in
interest rates on the fair value of the
Corporations debt is also presented in the
non-trading section. A 10% change in
foreign exchange rates and a 15% change in
the rate of interest over one year are
considered reasonable possibilities for the
purpose of providing sensitivity
disclosures.



     Non-Trading: The Corporations
non-trading activities include hedging of
crude oil and natural gas production.
Futures and swaps are used to fix the
selling prices of a portion of the
Corporations future production and the
related gains or losses are an integral
part of the Corporations selling prices.
As of December 31, the Corporation has open
hedge positions equal to 70% of its
estimated 2004 worldwide crude oil
production and 45% of its estimated 2005
worldwide crude oil production. The average
price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil
(WTI) related open hedge positions is
$26.24 in 2004 and $25.83 in 2005. The
average price for Brent crude oil related
open hedge positions is $24.51 in 2004 and
$24.41 in 2005. Approximately 18% of the
Corporations hedges are WTI related and
the remainder are Brent. The Corporation
also has hedged 30% of its 2004 United
States natural gas production at an average
price of $5.10 per Mcf. As market
conditions change, the Corporation may
adjust its hedge percentages.

The Corporation also markets energy
commodities including refined petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity. The
Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix
the purchase prices of commodities to be
sold under fixed-price sales contracts.


The following table summarizes the
value-at-risk results of commodity related
derivatives that are settled in cash and
used in non-trading activities. The
results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels change.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange
contracts to reduce its exposure to
fluctuating foreign exchange rates. To
counteract these foreign exchange
exposures, the Corporation enters into
forward purchase contracts for both the
British pound sterling and the Danish
kroner. At December 31, 2003, the
Corporation has $384 million of notional
value foreign exchange contracts maturing
in 2004 and 2005 ($307 million at December
31, 2002). The fair value of foreign
exchange contracts recorded as assets was
$40 million at December 31, 2003 ($18
million at December 31, 2002). The change
in fair value of the foreign exchange
contracts from a 10% change in exchange
rates is estimated to be $43 million at
December 31, 2003 ($33 million at December
31, 2002).


At December 31, 2003, the interest rate on
substantially all of the Corporations debt
is fixed and there are no interest rate
swaps. The Corporations outstanding debt
of $3,941 million has a fair value of
$4,440 million at December 31, 2003 (debt
of $4,992 million at December 31, 2002 had
a fair value of $5,569 million). A 15%
change in the rate of interest would change
the fair value of debt at December 31, 2003
and 2002 by approximately $270 million.

Trading: The trading partnership in
which the Corporation has a 50% voting
interest trades energy commodities and
derivatives. The accounts of the
partnership are consolidated with those of
the Corporation. The Corporation also
takes trading positions for its own
account. These strategies include
proprietary position management and
trading to enhance the potential return on
assets. The information that follows
represents 100% of the trading partnership
and the Corporations proprietary trading
accounts.


In trading activities, the Corporation is
exposed to changes in crude oil, natural
gas and refined product prices, primarily
in North America and Europe. Trading
positions include futures, swaps and
options. In some cases, physical purchase
and sale contracts are used as trading
instruments and are included in the trading
results.


Gains or losses from sales of physical
products are recorded at the time of sale.
Derivative trading transactions are
marked-to-market and are reflected in
income currently. Total realized gains for
the year amounted to $50 million. The
following table provides an assessment of
the factors affecting the changes in fair
value of trading activities and represents
100% of the trading partnership and other
trading activities.

The Corporation uses observable market
values for determining the fair value of
its trading instruments. The majority of
valuations are based on actively quoted
market values. In cases where actively
quoted prices are not available, other
external sources are used which incorporate
information about commodity prices in
actively quoted markets, quoted prices in
less active markets and other market
fundamental analysis. Internal estimates
are based on internal models incorporating
underlying market information such as
commodity volatilities and correlations.
The Corporations risk management
department regularly compares valuations to
independent sources and models.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Accounting policies and estimates affect
the recognition of assets and liabilities
on the Corporations balance sheet and
revenues and expenses on the income
statement. The accounting methods used can
affect net income, stockholders equity and
various financial statement ratios.
However, the Corporations accounting
policies generally do not change cash flows
or liquidity.



     Accounting
for Exploration and Development Costs: 
The Corporation uses the successful
efforts method of accounting for oil and
gas producing activities. Costs to acquire
or lease unproved and proved oil and gas
properties are capitalized. Costs incurred
in connection with the drilling and
equipping of successful exploratory wells
are also capitalized. If proved reserves
are not found, these costs are charged to
expense. Other exploration costs,
including seismic, are charged to expense
as incurred. Development costs, which include
the costs of drilling and equipping
development wells, are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization
of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas
properties are computed on the
unit-of-production method based on
estimates of proved reserves on a field
basis.


The determination of estimated proved
reserves is a significant element in
arriving at the results of operations of
exploration and production activities. The
Corporation uses independent reservoir
engineers to estimate all of its oil and
gas reserves. The estimates of proved
reserves impact well capitalizations,
undeveloped lease impairments and the
depreciation rates of proved properties,
wells and equipment. Reduction in reserve
estimates may result in the need for
impairments of proved properties and
related assets.



     Hedging: Hedging contracts correlate
to the selling prices of crude oil or
natural gas and the Corporation has
designated these contracts as hedges.
Therefore, the Corporation records gains
or losses on these instruments in income
in the period in which the production is
sold. At December 31, 2003, the
Corporation has $229 million of deferred
hedging losses, after income taxes,
included in other comprehensive income.


     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Goodwill: As explained below there are
significant differences in the way
long-lived assets and goodwill are
evaluated and measured for impairment
testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived
assets, including oil and gas fields, for
impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived
assets are tested at the lowest level for
which cash flows are identifiable and are
largely independent of the cash flows of
other assets and liabilities. If the
carrying amounts of the long-lived assets
are not expected to be recovered by
undis-counted future net cash flow
estimates, the assets are impaired and an
impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
impairment is based on the estimated fair
value of the assets determined by
discounting anticipated future net cash
flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the
present value of future net cash flows is
based on managements best estimate of
future prices, which is determined with
reference to recent historical prices and
published forward prices, applied to
projected production volumes of individual
fields and discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risks involved. The
projected production volumes represent
reserves, including probable reserves,
expected to be produced based on a
stipulated amount of capital expenditures.
The production volumes, prices and timing
of production are consistent with internal
projections and other externally reported
information. Oil and gas prices used for
determining asset impairments will
generally differ from those used in the
standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows, since the standardized
measure requires the use of actual prices
on the last day of the year.



28



 

The Corporations impairment tests of
long-lived exploration and production
producing assets are based on its best
estimates of future production volumes
(including recovery factors), selling
prices, operating and capital costs and the
timing of future production, which are
updated each time an impairment test is
performed. In 2002, the Corporation
recorded impairments of the
Ceiba Field and LLOG properties that were
required primarily because of reduced
estimates of oil and gas production volumes
and, in the case of Ceiba, anticipated
additional development costs. The
impairment charges did not result from
changes in the other factors. The change in
the estimated timing of production on the
Ceiba Field did not significantly affect
the undiscounted future cash flows, but did
significantly reduce the fair value of the
field determined by discounted cash flows.
The Corporation could have additional
impairments if the projected production
volumes from oil and gas fields were
reduced. Significant extended declines in
crude oil and natural gas selling prices
could also result in asset impairments.


The Corporation has recorded $977 million
of goodwill in connection with the purchase
of Triton. Factors contributing to the
recognition of goodwill included the
strategic value of expanding global
operations to access new growth areas
outside of the United States and the North
Sea, obtaining critical mass in Africa and
Southeast Asia, and synergies, including
cost savings, improved processes and
portfolio high grading opportunities. In
accordance with FAS No. 142, goodwill is no
longer amortized but must be tested for
impairment annually. FAS No. 142 requires
that goodwill be tested for impairment at a
reporting unit level. The reporting unit or
units used to evaluate and measure goodwill
for impairment are determined primarily
from the manner in which the business is
managed. A reporting unit is an operating
segment or a component which is one level
below an operating segment. A component is
a reporting unit if the component
constitutes a business for which discrete
financial information is available and
segment management regularly reviews the
operating results of that component.
However, two or more components of an
operating segment shall be aggregated and
deemed a single reporting unit if the
components have similar economic
characteristics. An operating segment shall
be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of
its components are economically similar.


Within the Corporations exploration and
production operating segment there are
currently two components: (1) Americas and
West Africa and (2) Europe, North Africa
and Asia. Each component has a manager who
reports to the segment manager. The
Corporation has determined the components
have similar economic characteristics and,
therefore, has aggregated the components
into a single reporting unit  the
exploration and production operating
segment. As a result, goodwill has been
assigned to the exploration and production
operating segment. If the Corporation
reorganized its exploration and production
business such that there was more than one
operating segment, or its components were
no longer economically similar, goodwill
would be assigned to two or more reporting
units. The goodwill would be allocated to
any new reporting units using a relative
fair value approach in accordance with FAS
No. 142. Goodwill impairment testing for
lower level reporting units could result
in the recognition of an impairment that
would not otherwise be recognized at the
current higher level of aggregation.


The Corporation expects that the benefits
of goodwill will be recovered through the
operation of the exploration and production
segment as a whole and it evaluated the
following characteristics in determining
that the components are economically
similar:







 
The Corporation operates its
exploration and production segment
as a single, global business.


 



 
Each component produces oil and gas.


 



 
The exploration and production
processes are similar in each
component.


 



 
The methods used by each
component to market and distribute
oil and gas are similar.


 



 
Customers of each component are similar.


 



 
The components share resources
and are supported by a worldwide
exploration team and a shared
services organization.


29



 
The Corporations fair value estimate of
the exploration and production segment is
the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated
cash flows of producing assets and known
developments, (2) the expected risked
present value of exploration assets, and
(3) an estimated market premium to reflect
the market price an acquirer would pay for
potential synergies including cost
savings, access to new business
opportunities, enterprise control,
improved processes and increased market
share. The Corporation also considers the
relative market valuation of similar
exploration and production companies.


The determination of the fair value of the
exploration and production operating
segment depends on estimates about oil and
gas reserves, future prices, timing of
future net cash flows and market premiums.
The effect of synergies is embedded in the
value of producing assets, known
developments and exploration assets.
Significant extended declines in crude oil
and natural gas prices, reduced reserve
estimates or failure to realize synergies
could lead to a decrease in the fair value
of the exploration and production operating
segment that could result in an impairment
of goodwill. In addition, changes in
management structure or sales or
dispositions of a portion of the
exploration and production segment may
result in goodwill impairment.


Because there are significant differences
in the way long-lived assets and goodwill
are evaluated and measured for impairment
testing, there may be impairments of
individual assets which would not cause
an impairment of the $977 million of
goodwill assigned to the exploration and
production segment. In 2002, the
Corporation recognized asset impairments
because reduced estimates of oil and gas
production volumes caused the expected
undiscounted cash flows of the assets to
be lower than the asset carrying amounts.
No impairment of goodwill existed because
the fair value of the overall exploration
and production operating segment
continued to exceed its recorded book
value.



     Segments: The Corporation has two
operating segments, exploration and
production, and refining and marketing.
Management has determined that these are
its operating segments because, in
accordance with FAS No. 131, these are the
segments of the Corporation (i) that engage
in business activities from which revenues
are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii)
whose operating results are regularly
reviewed by the Corporations chief
operating decision maker to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the
segment and assess its performance and
(iii) for which discrete financial
information is available. Mr. John B. Hess,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of the Corporation, is the chief
operating decision maker (CODM) as
defined in FAS No. 131, because he is
responsible for performing the functions
within the Corporation of allocating
resources to, and assessing the performance
of, the Corporations operating segments.
Mr. Hess uses only the operating results of
each segment as a whole to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to each
segment and to assess the segment
performance. The CODM manages each segment
globally and does not regularly review the
operating results of any component (e.g.,
geographic area) or asset within each
segment or any such information by
geographical location, oil and gas property
or project, subsidiary or division, to make
decisions about resources to be allocated
or to assess performance. While the CODM
does review and approve initial corporate
funding for a new project using information
about the project, he does not review
subsequent operating results by project
after the initial funding. Each operating
segment has one manager. The segment
managers are responsible for allocating
resources within the segments, reviewing
financial results of components within the
segments, and assessing the performance of
the components. The CODM evaluates the
performance of the segment managers based
on performance metrics related to each
managers operating segment as a whole. The
Board of Directors of the Corporation does
not receive more detailed information than
that used by the CODM to operate and manage
the Corporation.

     Oil and Gas Mineral Rights: The oil
and gas industry is currently discussing
the appropriate balance sheet
classification of oil and gas mineral
rights held by lease or contract. The
Corporation classifies these assets as
property, plant and equipment in accordance
with its interpretation of FAS No. 19 and
common industry practice. There is also a
view that these mineral rights are
intangible assets as defined in FAS No.
141, Business Combinations, and, therefore,
should be classified separately on the
balance sheet as intangible assets. If the
accounting for mineral rights held by lease
or contract is ultimately changed, the
Corporation believes that any such
reclassification of mineral rights could
amount to approximately $2.3 billion at
December 31, 2003 and $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, if the Corporation is
required to include the purchase price
allocated to hydrocarbon reserves obtained
in acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
The determination of this amount is based
on the Corporations current understanding
of this evolving issue and how the
provisions of FAS No. 141 might be applied
to oil and gas mineral rights. If mineral
rights are reclassified to intangible
assets, FAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, will
require additional disclosures in the
financial statement notes. This potential
balance sheet reclassification would not
affect results of operations or cash
flows.


Environment, Health and Safety
The Corporation has implemented a
values-based, social-responsibility
strategy focused on improved environment,
health, and safety performance and making a
positive impact on communities and the
environment. The strategy is supported by
the Corporations environment, health,
safety and social responsibility policies
and management systems that help protect
the Corporations workforce, customers and
local communities. Overall governance is
the responsibility of senior management. To
ensure that the Corporation meets its goals
and regulatory requirements, the
Corporation has programs in place for
compliance evaluation, facility auditing
and employee training. Environment and
safety management systems, based on
international standards, are used
throughout the Corporation to ensure
consistency and adherence to policy
objectives. Improved performance in
environment, health and safety may raise
the Corporations operating costs and
require increased capital expenditures
while reducing potential risks to corporate
assets, reputation and ability to operate.


The Port Reading refining facility and the
HOVENSA refinery manufacture conventional
and reformulated gasolines that are cleaner
burning than required under U.S.
regulations currently in effect. In
addition, the benzene and sulfur content in
the Corporations gasoline is approximately
one-half of the national average (excluding
California), resulting in significantly
lower toxic emissions than the industry
average.


The regulation of motor fuels in the
United States and elsewhere continues to
be an area of considerable change and will
likely require large capital expenditures
in future years. In December 1999, the
United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) adopted rules that phase in
limitations on the sulfur
content of gasoline beginning in 2004. In
December 2000, the EPA adopted regulations
to substantially reduce the allowable
sulfur content of diesel fuel by 2006.


The Corporation and HOVENSA continue to
review options to determine the most cost
effective compliance strategies for these
fuel regulations. The costs to comply will
depend on a variety of factors, including
the availability of suitable technology and
contractors and the credit trading
programs. The estimated capital
expenditures necessary to comply with the
low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port
Reading are approximately $70 million over
the next several years. Capital
expenditures to comply with low-sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at
HOVENSA are presently expected to be $450
million over the next three years. HOVENSA
expects to finance these capital
expenditures through cash flow and, if
necessary, future borrowings.


Legislation to restrict or ban the use of
MTBE, a gasoline oxygenate, and to require
the use of renewable fuels was considered
by the United States Congress in 2002 and
will likely be reconsidered. The
Corporation and HOVENSA both manufacture
and use MTBE primarily to meet the federal
requirement for oxygen in reformulated
gasoline, and do not presently use ethanol.
Several states in the Corporations market
area have enacted bans on MTBE use,
including Connecticut and New York
(effective January 2004), and other states
are considering them. If Congress bans MTBE
or if additional state bans take effect, or
if an obligation to use ethanol or other
renewable fuels is imposed, the effect on
the Corporation and HOVENSA could be
significant. Whether the effect is
significant will depend on several factors,
including the extent and timing of any such
bans or obligations, requirements for
maintenance of certain air

31



 

emission reductions if MTBE is banned, the
cost and availability of alternative
oxygenates or credits and whether the
minimum oxygen content standard for
reformulated gasoline remains in effect.
The Corporation is reviewing various
options to market and produce reformulated
gasolines if additional MTBE bans take
effect.


In 2003, the Corporation and HOVENSA began
discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the
EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI).
The PRI is an ongoing program that is
designed to reduce certain air emissions at
all U.S. refineries. Presently over 40% of
U.S. refining capacity is operating under
PRI controls and an additional 37% of
refining capacity will be included in early
2004. Depending on the outcome of these
discussions, which will not likely be
concluded until 2005, the Corporation and
HOVENSA may experience increased capital
and operating expenses related to air
emissions controls. The PRI allows for
controls to be phased in over several
years.


The Corporation recognizes the worldwide
concern about the environmental impact of
air emissions. On a global scale, climate
change is an issue that has prompted much
public debate and has a potential impact on
future growth and development. The
Corporation has undertaken a program to
assess, monitor and reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases, including carbon
dioxide and methane. The challenges
associated with this
program may be significant, not only from
the standpoint of technical feasibility,
but also from the perspective of adequately
measuring the Corporations entire
greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation
is working to establish an internal
greenhouse gas reporting protocol that will
provide a common set of principles and
guidelines for reporting data from operated
facilities and from assets operated by the
Corporations partners.


The Corporation expects continuing
expenditures for environmental assessment
and remediation related primarily to
existing conditions. Sites where corrective
action may be necessary include gasoline
stations, terminals, onshore exploration
and production facilities, refineries
(including solid waste management units
under permits issued pursuant to the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act)
and, although not significant, Superfund
sites where the Corporation has been named
a potentially responsible party.


The Corporation accrues for environmental
expenses when the future costs are probable
and reasonably estimable. At year end 2003,
the Corporations reserve for its estimated
environmental liability was approximately
$85 million. Remediation spending was $12
million in 2003, $9 million in 2002, and $8
million in 2001. Capital expenditures for
facilities, primarily to comply with
federal, state and local environmental
standards, were $7 million in 2003, $5
million in 2002, and $6 million in 2001.
The Corporation expects that existing
reserves for environmental liabilities will
adequately cover costs to assess and
remediate known sites.

Cash dividends on common stock totaled
$1.20 per share ($.30 per quarter) during
2003 and 2002. Dividends on the 7%
cumulative mandatory convertible preferred
stock will total $3.50 per share ($.875
per quarter).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amerada Hess Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business: Amerada Hess
Corporation and subsidiaries (the
Corporation) engage in the exploration
for and the production, purchase,
transportation and sale of crude oil and
natural gas. These activities are
conducted primarily in the United States,
United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark,
Equatorial Guinea and Algeria. The
Corporation also has oil and gas
activities in Azerbaijan, Gabon,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and other
countries. In addition, the Corporation
manufactures, purchases, transports,
trades and markets refined petroleum and
other energy products. The Corporation
owns 50% of HOVENSA L.L.C., a refinery
joint venture in the United States Virgin
Islands. An additional refining facility,
terminals and retail gasoline stations are
located on the East Coast of the United
States.


In preparing financial statements,
management makes estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities in the balance sheet and
revenues and expenses in the income
statement. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Among the estimates
made by management are: oil and gas
reserves, asset valuations, depreciable
lives, pension liabilities, environmental
obligations, dismantlement costs and
income taxes.


Certain information in the financial
statements and notes has been
reclassified to conform with current
period presentation.


Principles of Consolidation: The
consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Amerada Hess Corporation
and entities in which the Corporation owns
more than a 50% voting interest or entities
that the Corporation controls. The
Corporations undivided interests in
unincorporated oil and gas exploration and
production ventures are proportionately
consolidated.


Investments in affiliated companies, 20%
to 50% owned, including HOVENSA but
excluding a trading partnership, are
stated at cost of acquisition plus the
Corporations equity in undistributed net
income since acquisition. The change in
the equity in net income of these
companies is included in non-operating
income in the income statement. The
Corporation consolidates the trading
partnership in which it owns a 50% voting
interest and over which it exercises
control.


Intercompany transactions and accounts
are eliminated in consolidation.


Revenue Recognition: The Corporation
recognizes revenues from the sale of
crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products and other merchandise when
title passes to the customer.


The Corporation recognizes revenues from
the production of natural gas properties in
which it has an interest based on sales to
customers. Differences between natural gas
volumes sold and the Corporations share of
natural gas production are not material.


Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have maturities
of three months or less when acquired.


Inventories: Crude oil and refined product
inventories are valued at the lower of
average cost or market. For inventories
valued at cost, the Corporation uses
principally the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
inventory method.


Inventories of materials and supplies are
valued at the lower of average cost or
market.


Exploration and Development Costs: Oil and
gas exploration and production activities
are accounted for using the successful
efforts method. Costs of acquiring
unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold
acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers
fees and other related costs, are
capitalized.


Annual lease rentals and exploration
expenses, including geological and
geophysical expenses and exploratory dry
hole costs, are expensed as incurred.


Costs of drilling and equipping
productive wells, including development
dry holes, and related production
facilities are capitalized.


The costs of exploratory wells that find
oil and gas reserves are capitalized
pending determination of whether proved
reserves have been found. In an area
requiring a major capital expenditure
before production can begin, an exploration
well is carried as an asset if sufficient
reserves are discovered to justify its
completion as a production well, and
additional

40



 

exploration drilling is underway or firmly
planned. The Corporation does not
capitalize the cost of other exploratory
wells for more than one year unless proved
reserves are found.


Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization:
The Corporation calculates depletion
expense for acquisition costs of proved
properties using the units of production
method over proved oil and gas reserves.
Depreciation and depletion expense for oil
and gas production equipment and wells is
calculated using the units of production
method over proved developed oil and gas
reserves. Depreciation of all other plant
and equipment is determined on the
straight-line method based on estimated
useful lives.


Provisions for impairment of undeveloped
oil and gas leases are based on periodic
evaluations and other factors.


Asset Retirement Obligations: The
Corporation recognizes a liability for the
fair value of legally required asset
retirement obligations associated with
long-lived assets in the period in which
the retirement obligations are incurred.
The Corporation capitalizes the associated
asset retirement costs as part of the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets.


Retirement of Property, Plant and
Equipment: Costs of property, plant and
equipment retired or otherwise disposed of,
less accumulated reserves, are reflected in
non-operating income.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The
Corporation reviews long-lived assets,
including oil and gas properties at a
field level, for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not
be recovered. If the carrying amounts are
not expected to be recovered by
undiscounted future cash flows, the assets
are impaired and an impairment loss is
recorded. The amount of impairment is
based on the estimated fair value of the
assets determined by discounting
anticipated future net cash flows. In the
case of oil and gas fields, the net
present value of future cash flows is
based on managements best estimate of
future prices, which is determined with
reference to recent historical prices and
published forward prices, applied to
projected production volumes of individual
fields and discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risks involved. The
projected production volumes represent
reserves, including probable reserves,
expected to be produced based on a
stipulated amount of capital expenditures.
The production volumes, prices and timing
of production are consistent with internal
projections and
other externally reported information. Oil
and gas prices used for determining asset
impairments will generally differ from
those used at year-end in the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash
flows.


Impairment of Equity Investees: The
Corporation reviews equity method
investments for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that
an other than temporary decline in value
has occurred. The amount of the impairment
is based on quoted market prices, where
available, or other valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flows.


Impairment of Goodwill:
In accordance with FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
goodwill cannot be amortized; however, it
must be tested annually for impairment.
This impairment test is calculated at the
reporting unit level, which is the
exploration and production segment for the
Corporations goodwill. The Corporation
identifies potential impairments by
comparing the fair value of the reporting
unit to its book value, including goodwill.
If the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is
not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds
the fair value, the Corporation calculates
the possible impairment loss by comparing
the implied fair value of goodwill with the
carrying amount. If the implied fair value
of goodwill is less than the carrying
amount, an impairment would be recorded.


Maintenance and Repairs: The estimated
costs of major maintenance, including
turnarounds at the Port Reading refining
facility, are accrued. Other expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged
against income as incurred. Renewals and
improvements are treated as additions to
property, plant and equipment, and items
replaced are treated as retirements.


Environmental Expenditures: The
Corporation capitalizes environmental
expenditures that increase the life or
efficiency of property or that reduce or
prevent environmental contamination. The
Corporation accrues for environmental
expenses resulting from existing
conditions related to past operations when
the future costs are probable and
reasonably estimable.



41



 

Employee Stock Options and Nonvested Common
Stock (Restricted Stock) Awards: The
Corporation uses the intrinsic value method
to account for employee stock options.
Because the exercise prices of employee
stock options equal or exceed the market
price of the stock on the date of grant,
the Corporation does not recognize
compensation expense. The following pro
forma financial information presents the
effect on net income and earnings per share
as if the Corporation used the fair value
method. The Corporation records
compensation expense for non-vested common
stock awards ratably over the vesting
period.

Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S.
dollar is the functional currency (primary
currency in which business is conducted)
for most foreign operations. For these
operations, adjustments resulting from
translating foreign currency assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded
in income. For operations that use the
local currency as the functional currency,
adjustments resulting from translating
foreign functional currency assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded
in a separate component of stockholders
equity entitled accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains or losses
resulting from transactions in other than
the functional currency are reflected in
net income.


Hedging: The Corporation uses futures,
forwards, options and
swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the
effects of fluctuations in crude oil,
natural gas and refined product selling
prices. The Corporation also uses
derivatives in its energy marketing
activities to fix the purchase prices of
commodities to be sold under fixed-price
contracts. Related hedge gains or losses
are an integral part of the selling or
purchase prices. Generally, these
derivatives are designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows or forecasted
transactions (cash flow hedges), and the
changes in fair value are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income.
These transactions meet the requirements
for hedge accounting, including
correlation. The Corporation reclassifies
hedging gains and losses included in
accumulated other comprehensive income to
earnings at the time the hedged
transactions are recognized. The
ineffective portion of hedges is included
in current earnings. The Corporations
remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as
hedges and the change in fair value is
included in income currently.


Trading: Derivatives (futures, forwards,
options and swaps) used in energy trading
activities are marked to market, with net
gains and losses recorded in operating
revenue. Gains or losses from the sale of
physical products are recorded at the time
of sale.


2. ITEMS AFFECTING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
2003: The Corporation recorded a pre-tax
charge of $58 million for premiums paid on
the repurchase of bonds. This amount
included premiums on bonds repurchased with
proceeds of the fourth quarter preferred
stock offering. The repurchased bonds
included notes due in 2005 and 2007 assumed
from Triton Energy at the time of the
acquisition. This charge is reflected in
non-operating income (expense) in the
income statement.


The Corporation recorded expense of $53
million, before income taxes, for accrued
severance and London office lease costs in
exploration and production operations. Of
this amount, $32 million relates to leased
office space and the remainder relates to
severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and
Houston. Over 700 employee and contractor
positions have been or will be eliminated
or transferred to other operators.
Approximately 240 employees are receiving
severance, $15 million of which has been
paid. The remainder is expected to be paid
in 2004. The estimated annual savings from
this cost reduction initiative is
approximately $50 million before income
taxes. The Corporation anticipates
realizing

42



 

approximately sixty percent of the
savings in 2004 and the full amount in
2005 and beyond. The 2003 expense is
reflected principally in general and
administrative expense in the income
statement.


Exploration and production earnings in 2003
include income tax benefits of $30 million
reflecting the recognition of certain prior
year foreign exploration expenses for
United States income tax purposes. In
addition, the Corporation recorded a
pre-tax gain of
$47 million from the sale of its 1.5%
interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
System. A pre-tax loss of $9 million was
recorded in refining and marketing earnings
as a result of the sale of a shipping joint
venture. Gains and losses on asset sales
are reflected in non-operating income
(expense) in the income statement.


2002: The Corporation recorded a pre-tax
impairment charge of $706 million relating
to the Ceiba field in Equatorial Guinea.
The charge resulted from a reduction in
probable reserves of approximately 12% of
total field reserves, as well as the
additional development costs of producing
these reserves over a longer field life.
Fair value was determined by discounting
anticipated future net cash flows.
Discounted cash flows were less than the
book value of the field, which included
allocated purchase price from the Triton
acquisition. The Corporation also recorded
a pre-tax impairment charge of $318 million
to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas
properties located primarily in the Main
Pass/Breton Sound area of the Gulf of
Mexico. Most of these properties were
obtained in the 2001 LLOG acquisition and
consisted of producing oil and gas fields
with proved and probable reserves and
exploration acreage. This charge
principally reflects reduced reserve
estimates on these fields resulting from
unfavorable production performance. The
fair values of producing properties were
determined by using discounted cash flows.
Exploration properties were evaluated by
using results of drilling and production
data from nearby fields and seismic data
for these and other properties in the area.
The pre-tax amounts of these charges were
recorded in the caption asset impairments
in the income statement.


During 2002, the Corporation completed the
sale of six United States flag vessels for
$161 million in cash and a note for $29
million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax
gain of $102 million. The Corporation has
agreed to support the buyers charter rate
for these vessels for up to five years. A
pre-tax gain of $50 million was deferred as
part of the sale transaction to reflect
potential obligations of the support
agreement. The support agreement requires
that, if the actual contracted rate for the
charter of a vessel is less than the
stipulated charter rate in the agreement,
the Corporation pays to the buyer the
difference between the contracted rate and
the stipulated rate. If the actual
contracted rate exceeds the stipulated
rate, the buyer must apply such amount to
reimburse the Corporation for any payments
made by the Corporation up to that date. At
January 1, 2003, the charter support
reserve was $48 million. During 2003, the
Corporation paid $5 million of charter
support. Based on contractual long-term
charter rates and estimates of future
charter rates, the Corporation lowered the
estimated charter support reserve by $11
million. While the Corporations eventual
obligations under the support agreement
could exceed the amount of the deferred
gain, based on current estimates, the
remaining amount recorded at December 31,
2003, $32 million, is appropriate.


Pre-tax net gains of $41 million were
recorded during 2002 from sales of oil and
gas producing properties in the United
States, United Kingdom and Azerbaijan and
the Corporations energy marketing
business in the United Kingdom.


The sale of the six United States flag
vessels related to the refining and
marketing segment and the remaining 2002
asset
sales related to exploration and
production activities. The pre-tax amounts
of these asset sales are recorded in
non-operating income in the income
statement.


The United Kingdom government enacted a
10% supplementary tax on profits from oil
and gas production in 2002. As a result of
this tax law change, the Corporation
recorded a one-time provision for deferred
taxes of $43 million to increase the
deferred tax liability on its balance
sheet.


In 2002, the Corporation recorded a
pre-tax charge of $22 million for the
write-off of intangible assets in its U.S.
energy marketing business. In addition,
accrued severance of $13 million was
recorded for cost reduction initiatives in
refining and marketing, principally in
energy marketing. Approximately 165
positions were eliminated and an office
was closed. The estimated annual savings
from the staff reduction is $15 million
before tax. The accrued severance was paid
prior to December 31, 2003.


2001: The Corporation recorded a pre-tax
charge of $29 million for estimated
losses due to the bankruptcy of certain
subsidiaries of Enron Corporation. The
charge

43



 

reflected losses on less than 10% of the
Corporations crude oil and natural gas
hedges.


The Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge
of $18 million for severance expenses
resulting from cost reduction initiatives,
all of which has been paid. The cost
reduction program reflected the elimination
of approximately 150 positions, principally
in exploration and production operations.
Substantially all of the pre-tax cost of
these items are reflected in general and
administrative expense in the income
statement.


3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In 2003, the Corporation took initiatives
to reshape its portfolio of exploration
and production assets to reduce costs,
lengthen reserve lives, provide capital
for investment and reduce debt.


In the first quarter of 2003, the
Corporation exchanged its crude oil
producing properties in Colombia (acquired
in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition),
plus $10 million in cash, for an additional
25% interest in natural gas reserves in the
joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand. The exchange resulted in a charge
to income of $51 million before income
taxes, which the Corporation reported as a
loss from discontinued operations in the
first quarter of 2003. The loss on this
exchange included a $43 million pre-tax
adjustment of the book value of the
Colombian assets to fair value resulting
primarily from a revision in crude oil
reserves. The loss also included a $26
million charge from the recognition in
earnings of the value of related hedge
contracts at the time of the exchange.
These items were partially offset by
pre-tax earnings of $18 million in Colombia
prior to the exchange.


In this exchange transaction, the
Corporation acquired the 50% interest in a
corporate joint venture that it did not
already own. Prior to the exchange, the
Corporation accounted for its 50%
interest in the corporate joint venture
using the equity method. Because of the
exchange, the joint venture became a wholly
owned subsidiary. Consequently, the
Corporation has consolidated this
subsidiary, which holds a 50% interest in a
production sharing contract with natural
gas reserves in the joint development area
of Malaysia and Thailand. At the time of
the exchange, the exploration and
production segment included the net book
value of fixed assets in Colombia of $670
million ($685 million at December 31, 2002)
and a related deferred income tax liability
of $142 million ($145 million at December
31, 2002).


In the second quarter of 2003, the
Corporation sold producing properties in
the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field
in Indonesia and several small United
Kingdom fields. The aggregate proceeds from
these sales were $445 million and the
pre-tax gain from disposition was $248
million. With respect to the assets sold in
the second quarter of 2003, the net book
value of fixed assets at the time of sale
was approximately $295 million ($275
million at December 31, 2002) and the
related dismantlement and deferred tax
liabilities were approximately $160 million
($170 million at December 31, 2002).


Sales and other operating revenues (net of
intercompany sales) from discontinued
operations were $97 million in 2003, $381
million in 2002 and $361 million in 2001.
Pretax operating profit for the same
periods was $82 million, $14 million and
$120 million, respectively. Income tax
expense (benefit) was $29 million, $(13)
million and $22 million for the same
periods. The net production from fields
accounted for as discontinued operations
in 2003 at the time of disposition was
approximately 45,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day.


4. ACCOUNTING CHANGE
On January 1, 2003, the Corporation changed
its method of accounting for asset
retirement obligations as required by FAS
No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. Previously, the Corporation
had accrued the estimated costs of
dismantlement, restoration and abandonment,
less estimated salvage values, of offshore
oil and gas production platforms and
pipelines using the units-of-production
method. This cost was reported as a
component of depreciation expense and
accumulated depreciation. Using the new
accounting method required by FAS No. 143,
the Corporation now recognizes a liability
for the fair value of legally required
asset retirement obligations associated
with long-lived assets in the period in
which the retirement obligations are
incurred. The Corporation capitalizes the
associated asset retirement costs as part
of the carrying amount of the long-lived
assets.


The cumulative effect of this change on
prior years resulted in a credit to income
of $7 million or $.07 per share, basic and
diluted. The cumulative effect is included
in income for the year ended December 31,
2003. The effect of the change on the year
2003 was to increase income before the
cumulative effect of the accounting change
by $3 million, after-

44



 

tax ($.03 per share diluted). Assuming
the accounting change had been applied
retroactively to January 1, 2001 (rather
than January 1, 2003), there would not
have been a material change
in income from continuing operations and
net income in 2002 and 2001.


The following table describes changes to
the Corporations asset retirement
obligations:

If FAS No. 143 had been applied beginning
January 1, 2002 (rather than at January 1,
2003), the pro forma liability for asset
retirement obligations at that date would
have been $537 million.


The Corporation has adopted Emerging Issues
Task Force abstract 02-3, Issues Involved
in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved
in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities. In accordance with EITF 02-3,
the Corporation began accounting for
trading inventory purchased after October
25, 2002 at the lower of cost or market.
Inventory purchased prior to this date was
marked-to-market with changes reflected in
income currently. Beginning January 1,
2003, the Corporation accounted for all
trading inventory at the lower of cost or
market. This accounting change did not have
a material effect on the Corporations
income or financial position.


The oil and gas industry is currently
discussing the appropriate balance sheet
classification of oil and gas mineral
rights held by lease or contract. The
Corporation classifies these assets as
property, plant and equipment in
accordance with its interpretation of FAS
No. 19 and common industry practice. There
is also a view that these mineral rights
are intangible assets as defined in FAS
No. 141, Business Combinations, and,
therefore, should be classified separately
on the balance sheet as intangible assets. If the accounting for mineral rights held
by lease or contract is ultimately changed,
the Corporation believes that any such
reclassification of mineral rights could
amount to approximately $2.3 billion at
December 31, 2003, and $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, if the Corporation is
required to include the purchase price
allocated to hydrocarbon reserves obtained
in acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
The determination of this amount is based
on the Corporations current understanding
of this evolving issue and how the
provisions of FAS No. 141 might be applied
to oil and gas mineral rights. If mineral
rights are reclassified to intangible
assets, FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, will require additional
disclosures in the financial statement
footnotes. This potential balance sheet
reclassification would not affect results
of operations or cash flows.


5. ACQUISITION OF TRITON ENERGY LIMITED
In 2001, the Corporation acquired 100% of
the outstanding ordinary shares of Triton
Energy Limited, an international oil and
gas exploration and production company. The
Corporations consolidated financial
statements include Tritons results of
operations from August 14, 2001. The
purchase price resulted in the recognition
of goodwill of $977 million. Factors
contributing to the recognition of goodwill
included the strategic value of expanding
global operations to access new growth
areas outside of the United States and the
North Sea, obtaining critical mass in
Africa and Southeast Asia, and synergies,
including cost savings, improved processes
and portfolio high grading opportunities.
The goodwill is assigned to the exploration
and production reporting unit and is not
deductible for income tax purposes.

7. REFINING JOINT VENTURE
The Corporation has an investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., a 50% joint venture with
Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in
the Virgin Islands, previously wholly-owned by the Corporation.


The Corporation accounts for its investment in HOVENSA using the equity method.

*The Corporations share of HOVENSAs income was $117 million in 2003 and $58
million in 2001. The Corporations share of the 2002 loss was $47 million. The
Corporations share of HOVENSAs undistributed income aggregated $240 million
at December 31, 2003.
The Corporation has agreed to purchase 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined
products at market
prices, after sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Such purchases amounted
to approximately $2,040 million during 2003, $1,280 million during 2002 and
$1,500 million during 2001. The Corporation sold crude oil to HOVENSA for
approximately $410 million during 2003, $80 million during 2002 and $110
million during 2001. In addition, the Corporation billed HOVENSA freight
charter costs of $59 million during 2003, $20 million during 2002 and $55
million during 2001.


The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value of HOVENSAs
crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. At December 31, 2003, this
amount was $134 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of crude
oil purchased and the related crude oil prices. In addition, the Corporation
has agreed to provide funding to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet
its senior debt obligations up to a maximum of $40 million.


At formation of the joint venture, PDVSA V.I., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PDVSA, purchased a 50% interest in the fixed assets of the Corporations Virgin
Islands refinery for $62.5 million in cash and a 10-year note from PDVSA V.I.
for $562.5 million bearing interest at 8.46% per annum and requiring principal
payments over its term. At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the
principal balance of the note was $334 million and $395 million, respectively.

During 2003, the Corporation recorded non-cash additions to fixed assets of
$1,340 million. Of this total, $485 million related to assets that were
previously accounted for as an equity investment in a company that holds
natural gas

46



 

reserves in Malaysia and Thailand. The remaining $855 million resulted from
asset exchanges. The Corporation also recorded deferred income tax liabilities
of $105 million related to the asset exchanges. The assets and liabilities
relinquished in these exchanges included fixed assets of approximately $770
million, an additional equity investment of $145 million and deferred income
tax liabilities of $145 million.



9. SHORT-TERM NOTES AND RELATED LINES OF CREDIT
The Corporation has no short-term notes at December 31, 2003. Short-term notes
payable to banks at December 31, 2002 amounted to $2 million, bearing interest
at a weighted average rate of 1.4%. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation has
uncommitted arrangements with banks for unused lines of credit aggregating $206
million.

The aggregate long-term debt maturing during the next five years is as follows
(in millions): 2004$73 (included in current liabilities); 2005$60; 2006$88;
2007$212 and 2008$129.


The Corporations long-term debt agreements contain restrictions on the amount
of total borrowings and cash dividends allowed. At December 31, 2003, the
Corporation is permitted to borrow an additional $5 billion for the
construction or acquisition of assets. At year-end, the amount that can be
borrowed for the payment of dividends is $1.9 billion.


During 2003, the Corporation repurchased $1,015 million of fixed rate
debentures consisting of most of the Corporations 5.3% and 5.9% notes due in
2004 and 2006, respectively, as well as notes due in 2005 and 2007 assumed from
Triton at the time of the acquisition. At December 31, 2003, the Corporations
public fixed rate debentures have a face value of $3,237 million ($3,222
million net of unamortized discount). Borrowings are due commencing in 2004 and
extend through 2033. Interest rates on the debentures range from 5.3% to 7.9%
and have a weighted average rate of 7.2%.


In connection with the sale of the Corporations interest in the Trans Alaska
Pipeline in January 2003, $20 million of Marine Terminal Revenue Bonds were
assumed by the purchaser.


The Corporation has a $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement, which was
unutilized at December 31, 2003 and expires in January 2006. Because of a
credit downgrade in February 2004, borrowings under the facility currently
would bear interest at 1.125% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A
facility fee of .375% per annum is currently payable on the amount of the
credit line. At December 31, 2003, the interest rate was .725% above the London
Interbank Offered Rate and the facility fee was .15%.


In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Corporation capitalized interest of $41 million,
$101 million and $44 million, respectively, on major development projects. The
total amount of interest paid (net of amounts capitalized), principally on
short-term and long-term debt, in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $313 million, $274
million and $121 million, respectively.

Exercise prices for employee stock options at December 31, 2003 ranged from
$45.76 to $84.61 per share. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of
employee stock options is 6 years.


The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
employee stock options for pro forma disclosure of the effects on net income
and earnings per share. The Corporation used the following weighted-average
assumptions in the Black-Scholes model for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 3.6%, 4.2% and 4.1%; expected stock price
volatility of .288, .262 and .244; dividend yield of 2.6%, 1.9% and 2.0%; and
an expected life of seven years. The Corporations net income
would have been reduced by approximately $1 million in 2003 and $14 million in

12. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Foreign currency gains (losses) from continuing operations before income taxes
amounted to $(6) million in 2003, $26 million in 2002 and $(22) million in
2001.


The balances in accumulated other comprehensive income related to foreign
currency translation were reductions in stockholders equity of $94 million at
December 31, 2003 and $107 million at December 31, 2002.



13. PENSION PLANS
The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for
substantially all of its employees. In addition, the Corporation has an
unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees. The
unfunded supplemental pension plan provides for incremental
48



 

pension payments from the
Corporations funds so that total pension payments equal amounts that would
have been payable from the Corporations principal pension plans, were it not
for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined
benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The Corporation
uses December 31 as the measurement date for its plans.


The following table reconciles the projected benefit obligation and the fair
value of plan assets and shows the funded status of the pension plans:

Prior service costs and gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the
benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average
remaining service period of active employees.


The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used by the Corporations funded and
unfunded pension plans were as follows:

The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is based on historical,
long-term returns of the plan, adjusted downward to reflect lower prevailing
interest rates. The assumed long-term rate of return is less than the actual
return for the year ended December 31, 2003.


The Corporations funded pension plan assets by asset category are as follows:

The target investment allocations for the plan assets are 55% equity securities
and 45% debt securities. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a regular basis
throughout the year to bring assets to within a 23% range of target levels.
Target allocations take into account analyses performed to optimize long term
risk and return relationships. All assets are highly liquid and can be readily
adjusted to provide liquidity for current benefit payment requirements.


The Corporation has budgeted contributions of $82 million to its funded pension
plans in 2004. The Corporation also has budgeted contributions of $20 million
to the trust established for the unfunded plan.


Estimated future pension benefit payments for the funded and unfunded plans,
which reflect expected future service, are as follows:

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be
indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Undistributed earnings amounted
to approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 2003 and include amounts which,
if remitted, would result in U.S. income taxes at less than the statutory rate,
because of available foreign tax credits. If the earnings of such foreign
subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
approximately $100 million would have been required.


For income tax reporting at December 31, 2003, the Corporation has alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $120 million, which can be
carried forward indefinitely. The Corporation also has approximately $35
million of general business credits. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation has
a net operating loss carryforward in the United States of approximately $450
million. At December 31, 2003, a net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $500 million is also available to offset the Corporations share
of HOVENSA joint venture income and to reduce taxes on interest from the PDVSA
note. In addition, a foreign exploration and production subsidiary has a net
operating loss carryforward of approximately $550 million.


Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2003, 2002 and 2001 amounted to $361
million, $410 million and $605 million, respectively.

In 2003, the Corporation issued 13,500,000 shares of 7% cumulative mandatory
convertible preferred stock. Dividends are payable on March 1, June 1,
September 1 and December 1 of each year. The cumulative mandatory convertible
preferred shares have a liquidation preference of $675 million ($50 per share).
Each cumulative mandatory convertible preferred share will automatically
convert on December 1, 2006 into .8305 to 1.0299 shares of common stock,
depending on the average closing price of the Corporations common stock over a
20-day period before conversion. The Corporation has reserved 13,903,650 shares
of common stock for the conversion of these preferred shares. Holders of the
cumulative mandatory convertible preferred stock have the right to convert
their shares at any time prior to December 1, 2006 at the rate of .8305 share
of common stock for each preferred share converted. The cumulative mandatory
convertible preferred shares do not have voting rights, except in certain
limited circumstances.

tankers, floating production systems, drilling rigs, office space and other
assets for varying periods. At December 31, 2003, future minimum rental
payments applicable to noncancelable leases with remaining terms of one year or
more (other than oil and gas property leases) are as follows:

17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, NON-TRADING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES
On January 1, 2001, the Corporation adopted FAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement
requires that the Corporation recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at
fair value and establishes criteria for using derivatives as hedges.


The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment resulting from adopting FAS No. 133
was a cumulative increase in other comprehensive income of $100 million after
income taxes ($145 million before income taxes). Substantially all of the
transition adjustment resulted from crude oil and natural gas cash flow hedges.
The transition adjustment did not have a material effect on net income or
retained earnings.


Non-Trading: The Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps,
individually or in combination, to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude
oil, natural gas and refined product selling prices. The Corporation also uses
derivatives in its energy marketing activities to fix the purchase prices of
commodities to be sold under fixed-price contracts. Related hedge gains or
losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally, these
derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or
forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), and the changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are
recognized. The Corporations use of fair value hedges is not material.


The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses from accumulated other
comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are
recognized. Hedging decreased exploration and production results by $418
million before income taxes in 2003. Hedging increased exploration and
production results before income taxes by $82 million in 2002 and $106 million
in 2001 (including $82 million associated with the transition adjustment at the
beginning of 2001). The ineffective portion of hedges is included in current
earnings in cost of products sold. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not
material during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.



53



 

The Corporation produced 95 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas
liquids and 249 million Mcf of natural gas in 2003. The Corporations crude oil
and natural gas hedging activities included commodity futures and swap
contracts. At December 31, 2003, crude oil hedges maturing in 2004 and 2005
cover 93 million barrels of crude oil production (91 million barrels of crude
oil at December 31, 2002). The Corporation has natural gas hedges maturing in
2004 covering 18 million Mcf of natural gas production in the United States at
December 31, 2003 (35 million Mcf of natural gas at December 31, 2002).


Since the contracts described above are designated as hedges and correlate to
price movements of crude oil and natural gas, any gains or losses resulting
from market changes will be offset by losses or gains on the Corporations
production. At December 31, 2003, net after tax deferred losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income from the Corporations crude oil and natural gas
hedging contracts expiring through 2005 were $229 million ($352 million before
income taxes), including $196 million of unrealized losses. Of the net after
tax deferred loss, $185 million matures during 2004. At December 31, 2002, net
after-tax deferred losses were $91 million ($141 million before income taxes),
including $71 million of unrealized losses.


In its energy marketing business, the Corporation has entered into cash flow
hedges to fix the purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil, residual fuel
oil and electricity. At December 31, 2003, the net after tax deferred gains in
accumulated other comprehensive income from these contracts, expiring through
2007, were $45 million ($70 million before income taxes). Substantially all of
the deferred gains will be recognized in 2004.


Commodity Trading: The Corporation, principally through a consolidated
partnership, trades energy commodities, including futures, forwards, options
and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. The Corporations
income before income taxes from trading activities, including its share of the
earnings of the trading partnership amounted to $30 million in 2003, $6 million
in 2002 and $72 million in 2001.


Other Financial Instruments: Foreign currency contracts are used to protect the
Corporation from fluctuations in exchange rates. The Corporation enters into
foreign currency contracts, which are not designated as hedges, and
the change in fair value is included in income currently. The Corporation has
$384 million of notional value foreign currency forward contracts maturing in
2004 and 2005 ($307 million at December 31, 2002). Notional amounts do not
quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are
used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts. The fair
values of the foreign currency forward contracts recorded by the Corporation
were receivables of $40 million at December 31, 2003 and $18 million at
December 31, 2002.


The Corporation also has $229 million in letters of credit outstanding at
December 31, 2003 ($149 million at December 31, 2002). Of the total letters of
credit outstanding at December 31, 2003, $7 million represents contingent
liabilities; the remaining $222 million relates to liabilities recorded on the
balance sheet.


Fair Value Disclosure: The Corporation estimates the fair value of its
fixed-rate notes receivable and debt generally
using discounted cash flow analysis based on current interest rates for
instruments with similar maturities. Foreign currency exchange contracts are
valued based on current termination values or quoted market prices of
comparable contracts. The Corporations valuation of commodity contracts
considers quoted market prices where applicable. In the absence of quoted
market prices, the Corporation values contracts at fair value considering time
value, volatility of the underlying commodities and other factors.


The following table presents the year-end fair values of energy commodities and
derivative financial instruments used in non-trading and trading activities:

activities, generally approximate their fair values at December 31, 2003 and

Credit Risks: The Corporations financial instruments expose it to credit risks
and may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to
continuing review and full performance is anticipated. The Corporation reduces
its risk related to certain counterparties by using master netting agreements
and requiring collateral, generally cash.


In its trading activities the Corporation has net receivables of $351 million
at December 31, 2003, which are concentrated with counterparties as follows:
domestic and foreign trading companies  25%, gas and power companies  25%,
banks and major financial institutions  22%, government entities 15% and
integrated energy companies  7%.



18. GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES
In the normal course of business, the Corporation provides guarantees
principally for investees of the Corporation. These guarantees are contingent
commitments that ensure performance for repayment of borrowings and other
arrangements. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the
Corporation could be required to make under its guarantees at December 31, 2003
is $99 million ($358 million at December 31, 2002). This amount includes the
Corporations guarantee of $40 million of the senior debt obligation of HOVENSA
(see note 7). The remainder relates generally to a loan guarantee of a natural
gas pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 5% interest. The amount of this
guarantee declines over its term.


The Corporation is subject to contingent liabilities with respect to existing
or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Corporation considers
these routine and incidental to its business and not material to its financial
position or results of operations. The Corporation accrues liabilities when the
future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Amerada Hess Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements of
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated
subsidiaries were prepared by and are the
responsibility of management. These
financial statements conform with
generally accepted accounting principles
and are, in part, based on estimates and
judgements of management. Other
information included in this Annual Report
is consistent with that in the
consolidated financial statements.


The Corporation maintains a system of
internal controls designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded and that transactions are
properly executed and recorded. Judgements
are required to balance the relative costs
and benefits of this system of internal
controls.


The Corporations consolidated financial
statements have been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, independent auditors, who have
been appointed by the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors and approved by the
stockholders. Ernst & Young LLP assesses
the Corporations system of internal
controls and performs tests and procedures
that they consider necessary to arrive at
an opinion on the fairness of the
consolidated financial statements.


The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors consists solely of independent
directors. The Audit Committee meets
periodically with the independent auditors,
internal auditors and management to review
and discuss the annual audit scope and
plans, the adequacy of staffing, the system
of internal controls and the results of
examinations. In 2003, the Audit Committee
met three times with the independent
auditors and three times with the internal
auditors without management present. The
Audit Committee also reviews the
Corporations financial statements with
management and the independent auditors.
This review includes a discussion of
accounting principles, significant
judgements inherent in the financial
statements, disclosures and such other
matters required by generally accepted
auditing standards. Ernst & Young LLP and
the Corporations internal auditors have
unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Amerada Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet of Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the
related consolidated statements of income,
retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital
in excess of par value and comprehensive
income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2003. These
financial statements are the responsibility
of the Corporations management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our
audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the
consolidated results of their operations
and their consolidated cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.


As discussed in Notes 4 and 17 to the
consolidated financial statements, the
Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations,
effective January 1, 2003, and Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, effective January 1,
2001.

SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED)
Amerada Hess Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries

The supplementary oil and gas data that
follows is presented in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(FAS) No. 69, Disclosures about Oil and Gas
Producing Activities, and includes (1)
costs incurred, capitalized costs and
results of operations relating to oil and
gas producing activities, (2) net proved
oil and gas reserves, and (3) a
standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows relating to proved oil and
gas reserves, including a reconciliation of
changes therein.


The Corporation produces crude oil
and/or natural gas in the United States,
Europe, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria,
Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand and
Azerbaijan. Exploration activities are
also conducted, or are planned, in
additional countries.


In 2001 and 2002, the Corporation had two
equity investees and reported its
proportionate share of their oil and gas
data in the following tables. As a result
of transactions in
2003, one of these equity investees was
consolidated and the other was exchanged
for other oil and gas interests.
Previously, the Corporation owned a 25%
interest in certain oil and gas fields in
the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand (JDA) through a 50% investment in
a joint venture that was accounted for as
an equity investment. In 2003, the
Corporation exchanged producing properties
in Colombia for the remaining 50% of the
JDA joint venture. As a result of this
exchange, the Corporation has consolidated
its oil and gas interests in the JDA. In
2003, the Corporation exchanged its 25%
equity investment in Premier Oil plc for an
interest in a producing field in Indonesia.


During 2003, the Corporation exchanged its
interests in producing oil and gas fields
in the United Kingdom for an increased
interest in a Gulf of Mexico field under
development. The Corporation sold producing
properties in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the
Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small
United Kingdom fields in 2003.

The results of operations for oil and gas
producing activities shown below exclude
sales of purchased natural gas,
non-operating income (including gains on
sales of oil and gas properties), interest
expense and gains and losses resulting from
foreign exchange transactions. Therefore,
these results
are on a different basis than the net
income from exploration and production
operations reported in managements
discussion and analysis of results of
operations and in Note 19 to the financial
statements.

The Corporations net oil and gas reserves
have been estimated by independent
consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughton. The
reserves in the tabulation below include
proved undeveloped crude oil and natural
gas reserves that will require substantial
future development expenditures. On
a barrel of oil equivalent basis, 32% of
the Corporations December 31, 2003
worldwide proved reserves are undeveloped.
The estimates of the Corporations proved
reserves of crude oil and natural gas
(after deducting royalties and operating
interests owned by others) follow:

(a)
 
Includes the impact of changes in selling prices on production sharing
contracts with cost recovery provisions and stipulated rates of return. In 2003
such revisions were immaterial. In 2002 revisions included reductions of
approximately 44 million barrels of crude oil and 26 million Mcf of natural gas
relating to higher selling prices. In 2002 revisions also reflected reductions
in reserves on fields acquired in the LLOG and Triton acquisitions.





(b)
 
Includes the reclassification of reserves to Africa, Asia and other from
Equity Investees as a result of the consolidation of the Corporations
interest in the JDA.





(c)
 
Includes additions and reductions to reserves from asset exchanges.





(d)
 
Includes 32% of crude oil reserves and 43% of natural gas reserves held
under production sharing contracts. These reserves are located outside of the
United States and are subject to different political and economic risks.





(e)
 
Excludes 443 million Mcf of carbon dioxide gas for sale or use in company
operations.

The standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows relating to proved
oil and gas reserves required to be
disclosed by FAS No. 69 is based on
assumptions and judgements. As a result,
the future net cash flow estimates are
highly subjective and could be materially
different if other assumptions were used.
Therefore, caution should be exercised in
the use of the data presented below.


Future net cash flows are calculated by
applying year-end oil and gas selling
prices (adjusted for price changes provided
by contractual arrangements) to estimated
future production of proved oil and gas
reserves, less estimated future development
and production costs, which are based on
year-end costs and existing economic
assumptions. Future income
tax expenses are computed by applying the
appropriate year-end statutory tax rates
to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to
the Corporations proved oil and gas
reserves. Future net cash flows are
discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%.
No recognition is given in the discounted
future net cash flow estimates to
depreciation, depletion, amortization and
lease impairment, exploration expenses,
interest expense, corporate general and
administrative expenses and changes in
future prices and costs. The selling
prices of crude oil and natural gas are
highly volatile. The year-end prices,
which are required to be used for the
discounted future net cash flows and do
not include the effects of hedges, may not
be representative of future selling
prices.
